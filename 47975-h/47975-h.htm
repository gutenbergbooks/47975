<p class="chaptitle">AN OLD FRIEND.</p>


<p>"Py chimineddy!" muttered Carl Pretzel to himself,
starting up on the couch, where he had been snatching
forty winks by way of passing the time. "Vat's dot?
Der voice has some familiar sounds mit me. Lisden
vonce."</p>

<p>A loud, jovial voice floated in through the open window,
a voice with a swing to it that set Carl's nerves in
a flutter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'In Cawsand bay lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a Blue Peter flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hands were turned up the anchor to weigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">There came a young lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As fair as a May-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And modestly hailing, the damsel did say:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"'"I've got a young man there,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">D'ye hear? Bear a hand there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hoist me aboard or to bring him to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Which his name's Henry Grady,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And I am a lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just come down to purwent his a-going to sea."'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The roaring song had come closer and closer. By then
it was almost under the open window. Jumping from
the couch, Carl ran across the room and looked out.</p>

<p>A youth of seventeen or eighteen, wearing a sailor rig
and with his hat cocked over one eye, was lurching along
with both hands in his pockets. Behind him trailed four
or five hoodlums, bunched close together and talking
among themselves.</p>

<p>"Here's where I quit you, you lubbers," said the young
sailor, halting at the steps leading up to the boarding-house
door, and turning to the hoodlums. "A messmate
of mine berths here, and I'm going to drop in on him
and have a bit of a chat over old times. 'Bout ship, the
lot of you, and make a good offing. I don't like the cut
of your jibs any too well, anyhow. Slant away, slant
away."</p>

<p>The sailor backed up against a post at the bottom of
the steps.</p>

<p>"Say, yous ole webfoot," said one of the hoodlums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
"loosen up, can't yous, an' fork over the price o' a drink,
all around?"</p>

<p>The fellow shambled closer to the sailor and held out
one hand with an expectant grin.</p>

<p>"Not a bob will I give you for a tot of drink," answered
the sailor, "for I'll be keelhauled if you don't look as
though you'd already been topping the boom too much
for your own good, but I'll loosen up, as you call it, for
a good meal all around."</p>

<p>His hand went into the pocket of his trousers and he
drew out a big roll of bills. A greedy gleam darted into
the hoodlum's eyes as he glimpsed the bundle of money,
and those at his back pushed closer together, nudging
each other in the ribs and pointing while the sailor's head
was bent.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rascal who had acted as spokesman for
the rest made a leap and a grab.</p>

<p>"Avast there, you loafing longshore scuttler!" yelled
the young tar. "What sort of a beachcomber's trick do
you call that?"</p>

<p>The hoodlum had whirled, the roll in his hands, and
was making off as fast as his legs could carry him. The
sailor sprang after him, but the rest of the thieving pack
jumped in his way and began using their fists, hoping to
give their pal the necessary time to get clear with the
money.</p>

<p>Carl Pretzel, with an angry shout, withdrew from the
open window, dashed from the room, down the stairs
and out at the front door. Without paying any attention
to the sailor and those with whom he was tussling, the
Dutch boy rushed past the struggling group and made a
bee line after the thief.</p>

<p>Carl was too fat for a swift sprinter, but the thieving
hoodlum was handicapped by a game leg, and Carl was
able to overhaul him slowly.</p>

<p>Looking over his shoulder in order to take in the situation
behind, the thief saw the Dutch boy, and redoubled
his efforts to get away. An alley lay just ahead, and the
thief turned into it. Carl plunged after him, but when
he got into the alley, the fellow with the money had mysteriously
vanished.</p>

<p>"Dot's a funny t'ing!" panted Carl, coming to a halt
and peering around. "Vere dit he go mit himseluf?"</p>

<p>Garbage barrels and boxes lined the alley on both sides.
Carl started onward again, peering sharply behind each
garbage receptacle as he advanced. Suddenly he discovered
the man he was looking for, crouching behind a
big box.</p>

<p>Carl was a little way beyond the box before he caught
sight of the thief.</p>

<p>"Dere you vas!" he yelled, as he faced about. "Now I
ged you, und I dake avay vat you got&mdash;yah, so helup
me!"</p>

<p>He rushed at the thief, and the latter got up, squirmed
around the end of the box, and leaped for the side of a
shed whose wall stood flush with the alley.</p>

<p>The shed had a square opening, about four feet from
the ground, for convenience in unloading wood. The
thief had his eye on the opening. If he could get into the
shed, he probably reasoned, he could run through into the
back yard of the house, gain the street in front, and so,
undoubtedly, evade his fat pursuer.</p>

<p>But he didn't make it. By the time he was half through
the opening, Carl was close enough to grab his thrashing
feet, and he hung onto them like grim death.</p>

<p>"How you like dot, hey?" jubilated the Dutch boy.
"You findt oudt, py shimmy, dot it don'd vas so easy to
ged avay mit money dot don'd pelong mit you. Oof you
shkin oudt, you leaf your feet pehind, und oof you don't
come pack indo der alley, den I pull you in two. How
vas dot for some fixes?"</p>

<p>"Wot's de matter wit' yous?" came the angry, muffled
voice from inside the shed. "Le'go 'r I'll kick a hole in
your face!"</p>

<p>"You vill I don'd t'ink," puffed Carl, still hanging to
the feet. "Gif oop der money, you dinhorn, oder I turn
you ofer py der bolice und you go to der lockoop."</p>

<p>The hoodlum made no move to return the money, but
continued to struggle wildly. With a firm hold on each
ankle, Carl laid back and pulled for all he was worth;
but the thief had caught hold of something inside and all
Carl's pulling didn't get him an inch toward the alley.</p>

<p>While the whole matter was at a deadlock, the thief
half in half out of the shed, and Carl tugging fruitlessly,
the young sailor appeared at the end of the alley. Taking
quick note of the situation at the shed, he gave a yell and
bore down in that direction.</p>

<p>"Well, strike me lucky, old ship," cried the young tar,
"this is my busy day and no mistake. Is that the duffing
son of a flounder that got away with my wad?"</p>

<p>"He iss der feller, Verral," panted Carl. "He don'd
vant to come out oof der vood shet."</p>

<p>"Hang onto his pins, matey," was the answer, "and
I'll fix him."</p>

<p>The sailor pushed his hands through the hole, grabbed
the hoodlum by the throat, and exerted a steady pressure.</p>

<p>This man&oelig;uvre was successful. Half strangled, the
thief's clutching fingers relaxed their hold, and the sailor
and Carl, between them, managed to drag him back into
the alley.</p>

<p>"Now, you pirate," cried the sailor, dropping down on
the captive, "where's that money? That was a raw play
you made and you might have pulled it off if it hadn't
been for my mate, here. D'you want to go below, in
irons? Where's the roll?"</p>

<p>"Look in his bocket vonce," suggested Carl.</p>

<p>"I'll kill you fer dis!" fumed the hoodlum.</p>

<p>"Stow that!" growled the sailor. "I've a knife at the
end of my lanyard, but there's nothing about this that calls
for cold steel. Drop down on his feet, Carl, and that will
hold him steady while I go through his clothes."</p>

<p>While the Dutch boy sat on the hoodlum's feet, the
sailor was able to push his hands into the thief's pockets.
The roll was found and appropriated, and both boys
leaped up.</p>

<p>The hoodlum floundered erect.</p>

<p>"I'll git even fer dis!" he scowled. "Yous can't run
in dat kind of a play on Nifty Perkins an' make it stick."</p>

<p>"Bear away!" cried the sailor angrily. "Maybe that'll
help you," and he gave the villainous scoundrel a kick
that sent him two yards on his way toward the street.</p>

<p>The hoodlum turned to shake his fist, and mutter a
threat, then started off at a run. When he reached the
street, the rest of his pals joined him. For a time they
hung about the alley entrance, apparently trying to make
up their minds whether it would be wise to attack the
sailor and Carl in force.</p>

<p>"Donnervetter!" cried Carl. "Dot looks like a shance
for some scrappings. I don'd vas looking for drouple,
aber you bed somet'ing for nodding dot I don'd dodge
any. Come along mit yourseluf, Verral! Led's gif dem
fellers Hail Golumby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cut away!" shouted the young sailor. "The swabs
that ran foul of me bolted as soon as you crossed that
other chap's hawse. I'd like to square my score with
them."</p>

<p>But the hoodlums did not wait. Carl and the sailor
looked altogether too war-like. By the time the two boys
reached the end of the alley, the street rowdies had taken
to their heels.</p>

<p>"A jolly fine lot they are!" cried the sailor contemptuously.
"You saved my roll for me, Carl. Haven't had
time to shake your hand before, but I can do it now to the
king's taste. Your flipper, mate!"</p>

<p>Carl gripped the sailor's hand.</p>

<p>"Vat a surbrise it iss!" he exclaimed. "I don'd haf
time to say mooch aboudt dot, eider, aber ven I heardt
you singing mit yourself, und looked oudt oof der vinder
und saw dot you vas Tick Verral, I ketched my breat' a
gouple oof times. Vere you come from, Tick?"</p>

<p>"From Denver, messmate," answered Dick Ferral.
"My uncle supplies me with plenty of money, but just
the same I'd hate to lose that roll. He made me a present
of it when I started for Quebec. But where's my old
raggie, Motor Matt? I stopped off here in Chicago just
to see him. Got his address from the Lestrange automobile
people, and I'm fair hungry to grip his fin, once more.
I'll never forget what Matt King did for me&mdash;and my
uncle won't, either."</p>

<p>"He don'd vas in Chicago schust now, Tick," said Carl.
"He vill be pack in two or dree tays, meppy. Anyhow,
oof he don'd come pack py do-morrow, meppy ve go oudt
vere he iss, und see him? Vat you t'ink oof dot?"</p>

<p>Dick Ferral's disappointment was keen, and he showed
it plainly.</p>

<p>"How far is he from here, Carl?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only a leedle vays. It iss in a blace vat dey call Sout'
Chicago."</p>

<p>"What's Matt doing out there?"</p>

<p>"Vell, ve hat some ructions oudt dere&mdash;a mighdy high
olt time, you bed you. Look at here vonce. Ven you
read somet'ing, den you vill know more."</p>

<p>Carl pulled a newspaper out of his pocket and held it
under Ferral's eyes, indicating a certain paragraph with
his finger.</p>

<p>What Ferral read was this:</p>

<p>"For Sale&mdash;The practicable air ship, Hawk, fully
equipped with gasoline motor, rudders, propellers, and
almost new gas bag. Apply to Chief of Police, South
Chicago, Illinois."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A TRAP.</p>


<p>"Well, sink me!" muttered Dick Ferral, staring at the
newspaper paragraph. "Have they really got so they
can navigate the air like they do the water? I've heard
of such things, but I didn't know they'd made a success
of them."</p>

<p>Carl threw back his shoulders and puffed out his chest.</p>

<p>"Vell, Modor Matt und me ve haf sailed der sky mit
der air ship," said he. "Matt sailed in der Hawk, und I
sailed in der Eagle. Ditn't you hear about dot? Vy, it
vas in der bapers."</p>

<p>"I haven't looked at a paper for a week," returned
Ferral curiously. "How did you and Matt happen to go
up in an air ship?"</p>

<p>"It vas like dis, Tick. Matt und me vas oudt peyond
Sout' Chicago taking some spins in a pubble, ven along
comes a runavay air ship, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A runaway air ship?" interrupted Ferral incredulously.
"Tell that to the marines, Carl!"</p>

<p>"Dot's righdt," insisted Carl. "Der air ship vas running
avay mit two fellers vat don'd know how to use
him, see? Matt und me shtopped it mit a rope vat vas
tragging on der groundt, und der rope proke avay und
der air ship vent on, aber vone oof der fellers in der car
tropped somet'ing oudt oof his bocket, vich Matt und I

der air ship to a svamp in Intiana, und I followed him
dere in der Eagle, und Matt turned der tables on der

or, The Rival Inventors."</p></div>

<p>"Well, keelhaul me!" exclaimed Ferral. "I'd give my
eyeteeth to be able to take a sail in an air ship. How
much do they want for this one?"</p>

<p>His hand wandered to his pocket, where he had replaced
the roll of money.</p>

<p>"Dey vant so mooch as dey can ged," said Carl.</p>

<p>"Why is the Chief of Police of South Chicago selling
it?"</p>

<p>"Prady, der feller vat owned it, vas a t'ief. Some oof
vat he shtole vas prought pack by Matt, und der air ship
iss going to be soldt to pay a leedle to some oof der odders
vat don'd ged der goots pack."</p>

<p>"What's Matt doing?"</p>

<p>"He shows der air ship off to fellers vat come to see
how it vorks. He is heluping der bolice, und dey gif him
den tollars a day for flying aroundt mit it."</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky!" exclaimed the impulsive Ferral,
slapping Carl on the shoulder, "do you think two thousand
plunks would buy the craft, Carl?"</p>

<p>"Nix, Verrai, I don'd. Oof two t'ousandt vouldt puy
her, den Matt vould haf owned her pefore now. He vants
der Hawk vorse as anypody you efer see."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we rake up enough between us to buy her?"
cried Ferral. "If Matt knows about her, and if she'll
sail successfully, I wouldn't like anything better than to
go from Chicago to Quebec by the air-ship route. What
a high old jinks that would be!"</p>

<p>"Pully!" exclaimed Carl, as highly elated over the
prospect as was Ferral. "King und Verral, oof der Air-ship
Limidet Line! Ach, vat a habbiness oof it couldt
come oudt like dot."</p>

<p>"King, Ferral &amp; Pretzel," said Ferral. "You'll be in
on the deal, Carl."</p>

<p>"Fife tollars' vort," returned Carl. "Dot's all der
money vat I got."</p>

<p>"We'll let you in on the deal just to have you along.
Matt will be captain, I'll be mate, and you'll be the crew."</p>

<p>"Py shinks," chuckled Carl, "I vould make a fine
crew."</p>

<p>"Does the Hawk handle easily?"</p>

<p>"So easy as I can't dell! You pull a t'ing und she goes
oop, den you pull anoder t'ing und she comes down, und
you viggle her aroundt mit some more t'ing&mdash;I don'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
know vat. Aber Matt can vork her so shlick as nodding.
Say, Verral, Matt can make dot air ship turn some handt-shprings
in der cloudts, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Avast there, Carl! I'll bet Matt can handle the
craft, all right, even if he can't make her do any hand-springs.
Do you suppose she'll be sold before we get out
to South Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Vell, I hope nod. Meppy ve go righdt avay, hey?"</p>

<p>"Sure! The quicker we go, the more chance we will
have to get the Hawk. If we&mdash;&mdash;" The boys had been
walking slowly back to the boarding house, and Ferral
suddenly broke off his words and came to a halt. "Oh,
hang it," he went on, "I'm due for a sail on the lake at
one o'clock. Merrick, a nice chap I met on the train
coming from Denver, invited me to go with him, and I
said I'd meet him across the Lake Street viaduct right
after dinner. I hate to cut away from Merrick like that."</p>

<p>"Vy nod ged him to sail us as near Sout' Chicago as
he can go?" suggested Carl. "Den meppy ve ged off der
poat und dake der shdreed car?"</p>

<p>"Right-o!" cried Ferral. "That's what we'll do. How
long before you can be ready, Carl?"</p>

<p>"Schust so kevick as I can go up py my room und ged
dot fife tollars oudt oof der pureau trawer."</p>

<p>"That's the ticket! But you don't need any money, old
ship, while you're with me. I've got plenty for the two
of us."</p>

<p>"Anyvay, Tick, I got to vash oop a leedle, und prush
my clothes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So've I. Those swabs handled me a bit rough, although
they didn't leave many marks on me."</p>

<p>Ferral was completely carried away with the idea of
buying the air ship, and he could talk of nothing else
while he and Carl were smoothing the kinks out of their
personal appearance, and riding downtown on the car.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o'clock and they did not have any
time to stop at a restaurant for dinner. But neither of the
lads thought of anything to eat&mdash;and that was what Carl
had a habit of thinking of at the right time, and between
times, so it will be understood how the prospect of securing
the air ship dazzled him.</p>

<p>A little sailing craft was bumping against the wharf
at the lake end of the viaduct. Although a small boat,
yet she had a cuddy forward, a cockpit aft, and was as
spick and span as snow-white canvas, clean decks, and
polished brasswork could make her.</p>

<p>A young fellow, rather loudly dressed, was leaning
against one of the posts to which the sailboat was moored.
He was smoking a cigarette, and, at sight of Ferral, ran
up to him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, my gay sailorman!" he cried. "I had a kind
of hunch that you'd go back on me, and wouldn't show
up."</p>

<p>"Whenever I say I'll do a thing," replied Ferral, catching
the other's hand heartily, "I lay my course in that
direction. But I'm in a rush to get to South Chicago. Do
you suppose you can take us somewhere near there?"</p>

<p>"Take you anywhere, old chap," returned the other.</p>

<p>Ferral presented Carl. The Dutch lad was not very
much taken with Ferral's friend. There was something
about him that rubbed Carl's fur the wrong way. However,
Carl did not pay much attention to this vague distrust.
He was thinking of the Hawk, and hoping that
he and Ferral would reach South Chicago in time to buy
the air ship before she was sold to anybody else.</p>

<p>Carl, more than anyone else, knew how Motor Matt
was longing to own the Hawk, and how badly disappointed
he was to think he had not the money to buy her.
Dick Ferral had dropped into the affair at just the right
time.</p>

<p>The name of the sailboat was the <i>Christina</i>, and her
skipper was a heavy-jawed Norwegian by the name of
Erickson. There was something about Captain Erickson
that Carl did not like, and the Swede who helped the skipper
sail the <i>Christina</i> did not appear to any better advantage.
Yet the idea of buying the air ship had put Carl's
nerves in a twitter, and he gave little heed to his vague
suspicions.</p>

<p>Merrick, Ferral and Carl got aboard the <i>Christina</i>, the
Swede cast off the bow moorings, the skipper hauled up
the mainsail and jib, and then the Swede threw on the
stern rope and jumped aboard. There was a fine breeze,
and the little boat tripped out through the harbor in the
direction of the government pier.</p>

<p>Ferral and Carl went forward and seated themselves
on the top of the cabin. Merrick lingered in the cockpit
to talk with Erickson, who had the wheel. The Swede
was farther forward, setting another of the jibs.</p>

<p>"How long you knowed dot Merrick feller, Tick?"
queried Carl.</p>

<p>"About a day and a half. Why?"</p>

<p>"His looks don'd make some hits mit me; und I don'd
like der Norvegian or der Svede, neider."</p>

<p>Ferral laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, Carl," said he, "you can't smoke a fellow's roll
on such a short acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I ged some hunches ven I see vat I don'd like, und I
got all kindts oof hunches, righdt now, dot somet'ing is
crooked. Meppy dot Merrick feller shmokes your roll&mdash;der
vone vat you got in your bocket."</p>

<p>"Belay, Carl! You'll like Merrick after you know him
a little better. I'll admit he's not exactly my style, but
he's no beachcomber. If anything happened, why, there's
two of us to three of them, and we could put up a pretty
stiff set-to. But South Chicago and the Hawk loom
pretty large in my glass, just now, and I haven't got time
to think of much of anything else."</p>

<p>Just at that moment a doubled-up form pushed out of
the cuddy into the cockpit. As the form straightened, and
turned around so as to face forward, Carl went off the
cabin at a jump and gave a yell.</p>

<p>"Prady!" he gasped; "Prady, or I vas a geezer!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">OVERBOARD.</p>


<p>Carl's yell drew the attention of all those on the boat.
Brady leaned over the top of the cabin and laughed huskily.
Merrick dropped his mask and joined triumphantly in
Brady's laugh. The Norwegian and the Swede stared
blankly for a minute, and then went stolidly on about
their work.</p>

<p>"Brady!" muttered Ferral, squaring around on the
cabin so as to get a good look at the man in the cockpit.
"Is he the swab that carried Matt off in the air ship,
Carl?"</p>

<p>"Sure he iss der feller!" averred Carl. "I vould know
him any blace. Ach, himmelblitzen, I toldt you I hat some
hunches, Verral!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've made a monkey's fist out of this," growled Ferral,
"and I'm a Fiji if I can understand the thing yet. The
way this Brady falls afoul of us don't look like a happenchance,
and yet I can't make anything else out of it.
Ahoy, there, Merrick! Stow that grinning and give me
the lay of this business."</p>

<p>"Merrick's real name is Brady," explained the outlaw
in the cockpit&mdash;and outlaw he was, having been a fugitive
from justice ever since Matt had navigated the Hawk
away from the swamp and into South Chicago. "He's
my son, Hector, Jr., and I'm proud of the way he worked
this deal," Brady continued, still laughing as though the
affair was a huge joke.</p>

<p>Ferral was bewildered.</p>

<p>"You're a thief, are you," said he, struggling to get the
matter clear in his head, "and the fellow who met me on
the train, and said his name was Merrick, is your son?"</p>

<p>"That's the how of it," returned Brady.</p>

<p>"Then I'm free to say," cried Ferral, "that I don't like
the how of it. 'Bout ship and takes us back to the wharf.
I'm a bit particular about the company I keep."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got a picture of us letting you go after
we've been to all the trouble to get you here. We'll put
you ashore somewhere to the north, my bantam, but before
we do that we'll frisk you for that bundle of long
green you've got in your pocket. The Hawk's for sale,
and I'm counting on buying her."</p>

<p>The more Carl heard and saw, the more puzzled he became.
It didn't seem like an accident the way Ferral had
met Brady, Jr., on the train, and yet the two Bradys must
have taken a long look ahead in order to bring about the
situation in which Ferral and Carl now found themselves.
Their plots, however, had centred about Ferral, and Carl
had merely blundered into them.</p>

<p>"I'll hear from you, Merrick," said Ferral sharply.
"What have you got to say about this?"</p>

<p>The <i>Christina</i> had passed through the break in the
government pier and was breasting the heavier waves in
the open lake. The pier behind was rapidly receding.
There were a score of fishermen on the piles, but they had
become mere dots, almost out of sight and entirely out
of hearing.</p>

<p>Carl looked around for a glimpse of some other boat.
There was a smudge of smoke from a steamer, off on the
watery horizon to eastward, and well to the south could
be seen the upper sails of a schooner, but these were the
only craft in sight, and they were too far away for any
practical benefit.</p>

<p>"There's nothing much to say," answered Hector, Jr.,
as calmly as though he had been talking about the weather.
"I was running a hand book on the Denver races,
but got a wire from dad that he was in trouble. You
happened to be on the same train that brought me to Chicago,
and when you flashed that roll on me, and I remembered
that I was nearly strapped and that dad needed
money, I figured on how I could annex such a nice fat
wad of the long green. You wouldn't play cards, you
wouldn't drink, and there wasn't anything else I could do
but make this sort of a play. I put dad next as soon as I
could get to him. He didn't think you'd show up to take
the sail, but I told him that you had said you would, and
that I believed you were the sort of a fool who always
did what you said. I reckon I was right, eh, dad?" and
Hector, Jr., came forward and leaned over the top of the
cabin beside his worthy father.</p>

<p>"Bright boy, son," said the elder scoundrel approvingly.
"We've got you, younker," went on Brady, Sr.,
again facing Ferral. "We're too far from land for you
to swim ashore, and I'm giving you credit for too much
sense to try a trick like that. It was a bit of a surprise
to me to see that Dutchman trailing along after you, but"&mdash;and
here a black scowl crept over the man's face&mdash;"I've
got a bone to pick with him and that meddling
whelp, Motor Matt. The Dutchman won't get away from
us so easily as you will, Ferral, I can promise you that.
And before Motor Matt is many days older, I'll show him
what it means to cross Brady's path."</p>

<p>Hector Brady, like his son, was a fair-spoken villain,
but none the less dangerous for all that. As he ceased
talking, he started to step from the cockpit to the aisle
of deck between the cabin top and the sailboat's side.</p>

<p>"'Vast, there!" roared Ferral, twitching at the lanyard
about his neck and bringing out a sheath knife. "Keep
your offing, both you sharks, or you'll find a knife between
your ribs. You've got us out in the lake, but you
haven't my money yet, and you're not going to cut up
rough with my raggie here. I got him into this mess, and
I'm going to see him out of it."</p>

<p>A boat hook, dropped by the skipper when he was
pushing the nose of the boat away from the pier, lay on
the deck close to Carl's feet. He bent down and picked
it up.</p>

<p>"Oof he makes some foolishness mit me," averred Carl,
"you bed my life I vill haf somet'ing to say aboudt dot
meinseluf. I had some hunches all der time," he harped
ruefully.</p>

<p>Brady, Sr., did not come out of the cockpit just then.
"There are four of us against you," said he sternly,
"and if you've got as much sense as I give you credit for,
you'll not resist. All I want of you, Ferral, is your money.
If what you told my son is true, your uncle is a rich man.
He'll give you another roll for the asking and never miss
it. Are you a pard of King's?"</p>

<p>"I'm all that," declared Ferral. "I owe Motor Matt
a debt I can never repay."</p>

<p>"And I owe him one I'm going to repay," said Brady,
with a black look. "He stole my air ship from me, and
I've got to buy it back. It's no more than justice that I
take part of the money from you&mdash;if you're such a good
pal of King's. I didn't think, any more than Hector,
that the thing was going to fall out like this, but my luck
must be taking a turn for the better."</p>

<p>"Skipper," shouted Ferral, looking at the Norwegian
over the heads of the two Bradys, "put about and take
us ashore! These scoundrels are trying to rob me."</p>

<p>The skipper, however, only returned a stolid look.</p>

<p>"You'll be hauled over the coals for this!" threatened
Ferral.</p>

<p>Carl had been on the point of saying something, but
off toward the west and south, over the stern of the sailboat,
he beheld an object that amazed him and aroused
a faint hope.</p>

<p>The object seemed to hang in the sky like a black
cylinder. It was the Hawk, there could be no possible
doubt about that, but was the Hawk sailing out over the
lake or merely traveling over the City of Chicago? So
far away was it that Carl could not tell whether it was
coming or going. Could it be possible that Motor Matt
was bringing the air ship in the direction of the <i>Christina</i>?
It seemed too much of a coincidence to be true, and yet
it was hardly stranger than the circumstances which had
enveloped Ferral in the net spread by the two Bradys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Carl, although the discovery of the air ship stretched
his nerves to tightest tension and filled him with fluttering
hope, kept the news of his discovery to himself. If the
Hawk was really heading lakeward, Brady, if he knew it,
might realize the possibilities of escape which it would
afford the two boys and take measures to keep the <i>Christina</i>
away from the air ship.</p>

<p>"No one is going to be hauled over the coals, Ferral,"
said Brady. "When we put you ashore, it will be in a
place from which it will take you a good long while to get
back to Chicago. Before you get back, I'll have a man
buy the Hawk, and I and my friends will make a quick
getaway to parts unknown. The Hawk means liberty for
me, for I can't dodge around on the ground and keep
clear of the police much longer. Are you going to hand
that money over, or have we got to take it away from
you?"</p>

<p>Shifting his sheath knife to his left hand, Ferral drew
the roll of bills from his pocket and stowed it snugly in
the breast of his blue shirt.</p>

<p>"If you get this money you'll have to take it," said he
defiantly, "and if that two-faced sea cook you say is your
son comes too close to me, I'll get him on the point of this
dirk."</p>

<p>Covertly, Carl was watching the round swaying speck
in the heavens. That it was round, proved that he was
looking toward the end of the gas bag, which, seen lengthwise,
would have been of cigar-shaped proportions; and
the fact that the object was growing larger by swift degrees,
proved that it was coming closer to the sailboat.</p>

<p>"Enough of this foolishness," scowled Brady, drawing
a revolver and leveling it at Ferral over the end of the
cabin. "Take that money out of your shirt and throw it
this way. If you make a miss throw and land it in the
lake, I'll plug you for that just as quick as I would for
not throwing it at all. It's up to you," he added warningly,
"and I'm not going to wait all day."</p>

<p>Carl, in the moment of silence that intervened, suddenly
hurled the boat hook with all his strength. The move was
entirely unexpected on Brady's part, and he was caught
unawares. The handle of the hook struck his arm a violent
blow, knocking the weapon out of his fingers and
dropping it overboard.</p>

<p>A yell of rage went up from Brady.</p>

<p>"Kick off your shoes, Tick," whispered Carl excitedly.
"Ven I gif der vort, chump indo der lake. I know vat
I know, und I dell you it vas all righdt. Do schust vat I
say, aber don'd say somet'ing."</p>

<p>The presence of the air ship was unknown to everyone
on the sailboat except Carl. To Ferral it looked like suicide
to jump into the lake, with no other boat anywhere
in sight.</p>

<p>"I'll kill you for that!" bawled Brady to Carl.</p>

<p>The Dutch boy paid no attention. He had already
kicked off his shoes and pulled off his coat. Holding his
coat in his hand, he leaped to the top of the cabin and began
waving it frantically.</p>

<p>The Bradys, the Norwegian and the Swede swept the
surface of the lake with their eyes. Even then their
glances fell too low to give them a glimpse of the Hawk.</p>

<p>Ferral had got rid of his shoes, although he was still
reluctant about taking to the water. Carl did not give
him much time to consider the matter, but grabbed him
by the arm and, when the little craft heeled to a strong
gust of wind, pulled him overboard.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">RESCUED.</p>


<p>All those on the <i>Christina</i> were astounded at the move
made by the two boys.</p>

<p>"Leave 'em in the water for a while!" shouted Brady,
Sr. "I guess that'll take the ginger out of 'em. Don't be
in any hurry, captain, about turning around."</p>

<p>The captain could not have turned very quickly, even
if he had wanted to. With all sail set, the <i>Christina</i> was
driving through the water at race-horse speed. It would
take time, and she would inevitably have to get a long
way from the boys before she could be put about.</p>

<p>Both Carl and Ferral were good swimmers and had
little difficulty in keeping themselves afloat, hampered
though they were with their wet clothing.</p>

<p>"We're in for it now, Carl!" gurgled Ferral. "That
sailboat will put about and we'll be hauled aboard&mdash;then
that swab of a Brady will have us just where he wants
us." Ferral rose in the water, shook his head to clear
his eyes, and peered after the <i>Christina</i>. "They're coming
around now," he added.</p>

<p>"Led dem come aroundt all vat dey blease," sputtered
Carl; "Matt vill pull us oudt oof der vet pefore dey ged
here."</p>

<p>"Matt?" echoed Ferral.</p>

<p>"Look oferheadt vonce, Tick."</p>

<p>Ferral took a look upward. Rushing toward that part
of the lake and swooping downward like a huge bird was
an air ship. The strange craft was almost upon him and
Carl. Two men were leaning over the guard rail of the
car on each side; both held coiled ropes in their hands,
and one of them was shouting instructions to Matt, who
was in charge of the motor.</p>

<p>The <i>Christina</i> was forging along on the back track, the
Bradys well forward and clinging to ropes while they
watched the man&oelig;uvres of the Hawk. It must have been
apparent to them that the Hawk would pick up the boys
before the <i>Christina</i> could come anywhere near them.</p>

<p>Splash! splash!</p>

<p>Two ropes dropped in the water just as the Hawk, with
a graceful, gliding motion, came to an even keel some fifteen
or twenty feet above the surface of the lake. The
whirling propeller lessened its speed and the air ship hovered
over the water.</p>

<p>"Grab the ropes!" shouted a voice from the Hawk's
car.</p>

<p>It was a useless suggestion, for the ropes had already
been caught.</p>

<p>"Can you climb up?" called one of the men. "It isn't
safe to bring the air ship any closer to the water."</p>

<p>Climbing the rope was easy for Ferral. Hand over
hand he lifted himself upward, was caught by the man
and pulled over the rail and into the car. But Carl was
no sailor, and every time he tried to climb the rope he
slid back into the water again.</p>

<p>"Hang hard," shouted the man in the car, "and we'll
pull you up."</p>

<p>The <i>Christina</i>, by then, was quite close. Carl had
hardly been lifted clear of the water before the crack of
a revolver rang out.</p>

<p>Brady, Jr., had passed his own revolver to his father,
and the latter was pecking away at Carl as he gyrated
under the car of the air ship.</p>

<p>"Keep a firm hold on that rope!" cried the man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
car. "We've got to ascend and get away from that sailboat."</p>

<p>The nose of the Hawk tilted sharply upward, the propeller
whirred at steadily increasing speed, and the air
ship bore swiftly away with the dripping form of the
Dutch boy swinging underneath.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! came the reports from Brady's revolver.</p>

<p>Carl, however, was not a good target, and, besides,
Brady had to fire from the pitching deck of the <i>Christina</i>.
All the bullets flew wide, and before Brady could fire
more than three shots the air ship was out of range.</p>

<p>The Dutch boy's position was in no wise comfortable
for his nerves. The Hawk was steadily mounting toward
the clouds, and Carl was swaying underneath like a pendulum.
As soon as the air ship was out of pistol range
of the <i>Christina</i>, however, hands were again laid on the
rope and Carl was jerked up to the car and pulled to
safety.</p>

<p>"Well, great spark plugs!" cried the voice of Motor
Matt. "Of all the brain twisters I ever ran up against,
this takes the banner! Where did you come from, Dick?
And how does it happen Carl is with you?"</p>

<p>Matt was in a chair at one end of the open space in the
middle of the car, his hands on the levers that worked
the mechanism and controlled the motor.</p>

<p>Ferral, wet as a drowned rat, was sitting up on the
floor of the car, his back against the rail. Across from
him was Carl. In the other end of the car were the other
two passengers. One of these wore the uniform of a
policeman.</p>

<p>Ferral's novel situation filled him with wonder. His
eyes were darting all around him, above at the swelling
gas bag, around him at the machinery, the propeller, the
rudder and space, and below him at the heaving expanse
of water.</p>

<p>"Well, strike me lucky," he breathed, "but all this seems
like a dream. Am I doing a caulk, and imagining I'm
wide awake? If I am, pinch me, somebody."</p>

<p>"You're not asleep, old chap," laughed Matt, "if that's
what you mean by 'doing a caulk.' Where did you come
from?"</p>

<p>"Denver. I'm on my way to Quebec. Heard you were
anchored in Chicago and stopped off there to see you.
Couldn't find you at home, but I did find Carl."</p>

<p>"How in the world did you and Carl happen to be on
that sailboat?" went on Matt. "And why did you jump
overboard?"</p>

<p>"Carl pulled me overboard," replied Ferral.</p>

<p>"It vas healthier for us in der vater dan it vas on der
poat," put in Carl, slapping at his wet clothes. "Aber I
vouldn't haf pulled Verral oferboardt oof I hatn't seen
der Hawk skyhootin' along toward us. Ach, dot vas
pully! How you habben to be vere you vas schust ven
ve needet you, bard?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jameson"&mdash;and Matt nodded toward the passenger
forward with the officer&mdash;"is thinking of buying the
Hawk, but he wanted to try her out with a good long
flight and to see if she would be perfectly safe over water.
So we sailed over Chicago and headed into the lake. We
saw that sailboat, but didn't pay much attention to her
until Harris saw some one waving something on her deck.
Then, thinking we were being hailed, we laid a course
for her. As we came closer, we saw two persons jump
into the water. That was our cue to get closer to the
lake and pick you up. But what was the matter on that
boat? You haven't told me yet."</p>

<p>Ferral ran one hand into the front of his shirt and
fished out his water-soaked roll of greenbacks.</p>

<p>"That's what caused the trouble," said he. "Brady
wanted the money."</p>

<p>"Brady?" Motor Matt looked questioningly at Carl.</p>

<p>"Yah, so," spoke up Carl. "It iss der same Prady vat
you hat sooch a time mit, ofer py Villoughpy's svamp."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Harris?" cried Matt, looking
at the officer.</p>

<p>"If Brady is on that boat," returned Harris, showing a
good deal of excitement, "we ought to tip somebody off
and have him captured."</p>

<p>"We'll turn back toward Chicago," said Matt. "Meantime,
Carl, you and Dick tell us all about how you got
into that fix. Hurry up with the yarn. If we're to do
anything toward capturing Brady, we haven't much time
to lose."</p>

<p>Carl and Ferral went over their recent experiences.
Matt's wonder grew as he listened. It was strange the
way events had fallen out and brought the three chums
together just in time to avert a robbery&mdash;perhaps a tragedy.</p>

<p>"It's main queer, mate, don't you think?" queried
Ferral, when the details had all been given.</p>

<p>"Queerest thing I ever heard of!" avowed Harris. "I
knew Brady had a son, but I hadn't a notion where he
was, or what he was doing. Looks as though young
Brady was a chip off the old block."</p>

<p>"It's a lesson for me," remarked Ferral ruefully, "never
to pick up a fellow on his own showing. The queerest
part of the whole business was my meeting young Brady
on the train, walking right into the trap he had set for
me and his father was going to help him spring, and towing
Carl along."</p>

<p>"We're coming close to the shore, King," called Jameson.</p>

<p>Matt stole a look over the side.</p>

<p>"Take out your notebook and pencil, Harris," said
he, drawing back, "and write a note. Address the memorandum
to the police department and say that Hector
Brady and his son are off the government pier in a sailboat
called the <i>Christina</i>, and that if the scoundrels are
captured, a tug better put off at once."</p>

<p>Harris scribbled the note. When it was finished, Matt
had him tie the small sheet of paper around a bolt taken
from the tool box.</p>

<p>"We'll fly low over the park near the Art building,"
said Matt, "and you yell to the first policeman you see,
Harris, and drop the note."</p>

<p>There was no need of yelling to attract anybody's attention
in the park, for every person was looking upward
at the air ship.</p>

<p>Harris was not long in sighting an officer, and his own
uniform demanded the officer's respectful attention.</p>

<p>The note was dropped, and those in the air ship could
see the policeman pick it up, untie the sheet of paper and
read the communication.</p>

<p>Before the Hawk got out of sight of the park, Matt and
the rest had the satisfaction of seeing the policeman wave
his hand to signify that he understood, and then hurry
off toward the lake.</p>

<p>"I guess that will cook Brady's goose for him," muttered
Harris complacently.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied with the Hawk, Mr. Jameson?" inquired
Matt.</p>

<p>"I never imagined that an air ship had been invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
which could be man&oelig;uvred as you have man&oelig;uvred this
one," said Jameson. "I'm so well satisfied with the Hawk
that I will give three thousand for her."</p>

<p>Carl gave a gasp and stared at Ferral, only to find that
Ferral was already looking at him.</p>

<p>Were Matt and Ferral to lose the air ship, after all?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BUYING THE "HAWK."</p>


<p>"An air ship's a hard thing to sell," observed Harris;
"about as hard, I should say, as a white elephant. Your
offer, Jameson, is the best one we've had, so far, and I
shouldn't wonder if you'd get the Hawk. What are you
going to use her for?"</p>

<p>"For a pleasure craft," was the answer. "I'm a member
of the Aëro Club and I'm tired of just plain ballooning.
I want to climb around through the air wherever I take
a notion, and not wherever the winds choose to carry
me."</p>

<p>"You won't make any mistake buying the Hawk at
three thousand," said Matt, a disappointed look on his
face. "If I had that much to spare, Mr. Jameson, you'd
never get her."</p>

<p>"Vell, Matt," spoke up Carl, "oof you vant somepody
to helup you oudt mit more money, vy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then Carl caught an expressive look shot at him
by Dick. The sailor shook his head. Carl couldn't understand
why he was saying more than he ought to, but bit
off his words.</p>

<p>Dick felt sure that if Jameson knew there was some
one else to bid over him, he would increase his bid, and
run it up until it would be impossible for Matt and Dick
to consider the purchase.</p>

<p>Jameson was undoubtedly a man of wealth, and able
to go any length in gratifying his hobby for air ships.
Matt, of course, did not know what Ferral and Carl had
at the back of their heads, for no mention had yet been
made of Ferral's desire to joint Matt in the purchase of
the air ship.</p>

<p>The return to South Chicago was quickly made, the
wind being behind the Hawk and helping her onward.
The aëronauts descended at Brady's old balloon house, in
a swamp field in the outskirts of South Chicago. Two
police officers were constantly on guard at the balloon
house to keep anyone from tampering with the air ship.</p>

<p>After the craft had been safely stowed in its quarters,
Matt, Carl, Ferral, Harris, and Jameson set off toward
town.</p>

<p>Carl and Ferral were in a sorry plight and in urgent
need of dry clothes and hats and shoes, but they were not
thinking of their own comfort. The danger of losing the
air ship was causing them a vast amount of worry.</p>

<p>"I'll take you fellows to a clothing store," said Matt,
as they came into the town, "and fix you out so you'll
look respectable. Everybody is looking at you as though
you were a couple of freaks."</p>

<p>"Belay that&mdash;for awhile," returned Ferral. "Take us
to a hotel, or anywhere else where we can have a talk."</p>

<p>"You can talk better if you're in dry clothes," said
Matt.</p>

<p>"Don'd you t'ink dot for a minid," palpitated Carl, with
an apprehensive look at Jameson.</p>

<p>The signs were plain enough to Matt that Ferral and
Carl had something they wanted to tell him. At the
place where they left Harris to pursue his way to police
headquarters, Jameson likewise broke away.</p>

<p>"You'll hear from me sometime this afternoon, Harris,"
said Jameson, "and when I come around I'll bring a certified
check for three thousand with me."</p>

<p>"You'll have to deal with the chief," answered Harris,
"and he's acting under instructions from the court. I
suppose your offer will take the Hawk, but I can't make
any promises."</p>

<p>"People are not falling over themselves to buy the air
ship," laughed Jameson, "and I guess my offer is the
best one you'll ever get. See you later."</p>

<p>Matt took his chums to the hotel at which he had been
stopping while in South Chicago. As soon as Carl and
Ferral got inside the hotel office, they grabbed hold of
Matt and hustled him toward some chairs in a corner
of the room where they could have a private talk.</p>

<p>"You fellows have got something on your minds,"
laughed Matt. "I've seen that for quite a while. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"How'd you like to own the Hawk yourself, mate?"
asked Ferral.</p>

<p>"I'd like it fine," answered Matt, his gray eyes brightening.
"If I had more money than I knew what to do
with, I'd buy the Hawk just to play with it."</p>

<p>"Jameson offers three thousand," went on Ferral. "If
you and I offered thirty-five hundred, and hustled the
deal right through before Jameson had a chance to overbid
us, we'd get the old flugee, eh?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" said Matt. "But where's the thirty-five hundred
to come from?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've got two thousand damp dollars in this roll.
If you can scrape up the other fifteen hundred, pard, we'll
go halvers on the buy and own the Hawk together."</p>

<p>Matt started forward in his chair. No one knew how
Motor Matt longed to own that air ship. Carl thought
he knew, but he didn't. It was a passion with Matt, almost
a mania, but he had held it under control by his iron
will.</p>

<p>Matt had his way to make in the world, and what little
money he had in the bank had come by hard knocks.
Would it be wise to put it into such a thing as an air
ship?</p>

<p>"You've got a wealthy uncle, Dick," said the young
motorist, "and I don't suppose he cares a picayune what
you do with your money. But it's different with me.
I've got to invest what little capital I have where it will
bring returns."</p>

<p>"It vill pring redurns oof you pud der money in der
air ship, Matt," fluttered Carl. "You can make ascensions
at shtate fairs, und a lod oof t'ings like dot."</p>

<p>"And maybe we can sell the Hawk, when we are
through with her," put in Ferral, "to the United States
government for a whole lot more than we paid for her.</p>

<p>"Und oof der gofermendt don'd vant der Hawk," said
Carl, "den meppy you can sell her py some feller like
Chameson for more as you pay."</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me!" exclaimed Ferral, struck by a sudden
thought. "They're offering all kinds of prizes now for
air-ship flights. We can get into some of them, mate,
and make more money than we ever dreamed of! Come,
old ship! Don't look as though you'd lost half a sovereign
and found a sixpence. Say the word and we'll go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
navigating the sky for all there is in it. It's a first-chop
game, you take it from me."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to Quebec?" queried Matt,
with a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"That's where I was bound for, but it makes no odds
how long it takes me to get to the place. Besides, when
I'm ready to pull out for the River St. Lawrence and
the gulf, why can't I sail there in the Hawk?"</p>

<p>Matt was thoughtful. It was not his habit to jump
into any new undertaking blindly, and there was something
mighty alluring about this air-ship proposition.</p>

<p>"I'll have to give up my job with the Lestrange
people," said he, "and there's a future to that."</p>

<p>"Future?" repeated Ferral. "Aye, mate, there's a prospect
that you'll go into a smash, one of these days, and
break your neck. Racing an automobile is risky business."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's not so dangerous as running an air ship,
at that," laughed the young motorist.</p>

<p>"Vell, anyhow," said Carl, "you don'd make some collisions
in a air ship oxcept mit der clouds. Air ships
ain'd so blendy like pubbles."</p>

<p>"I'll go you, Dick!" cried Matt suddenly, reaching out
his hand to grab Ferral's. "But," he added, "it will have
to be an even thing. You put in seventeen hundred and
fifty and I'll put in the same amount. That will make
each of us a half owner."</p>

<p>"Three times three and a tiger!" exulted Ferral, pulling
the roll of bills out of his pocket and counting off
the water-soaked notes. "There's your seventeen hundred
and fifty, matey," and he thrust the money into his chum's
hand; "now, slant away for the place where you pay it
over, and be sure you get ahead of Jameson."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time for that," answered Matt,
smiling at Ferral's impatience. "Jameson said he would
happen in on the chief sometime during the afternoon.
Why, it wasn't more than a half hour ago that we left
him."</p>

<p>"A whole lod oof t'ings can habben in haluf oof an
hour," said Carl. "Go on, bard, und finish oop der teal.
I von't be easy in my mindt ondil I know dot you und
Ferral own der Hawk. Himmelblitzen, vat a habbiness
dot vill be. Captain Matt, oof you blease, oof der air ship
Hawk, sailing from eferyvere und going der same blace.
Hoop-a-la! I vas so gay mit meinseluf as I don'd know.
Be jeerful, be jeerful!"</p>

<p>With that, Carl jumped up and began a war dance
around the office. He looked like a crazy man, shoeless
and hatless, and with his tow hair standing out all over
his head like an albino's.</p>

<p>Ferral was every whit as delighted over the prospect
as was Carl. He had to do a little jubilating himself, so
he got up and began a hornpipe.</p>

<p>"I'll get out of here," laughed Matt, starting for the
door, "before you fellows are pinched for escaped lunatics.
If I was around, the officers might nab me, too.
Get some decent clothes while I'm away."</p>

<p>With that, he started for the office of the chief of
police. On his way to headquarters, he passed a bank.
Just before he reached the bank, he saw Jameson come
hastily out the front door and hurry to a cab that was
waiting beside the walk.</p>

<p>"Police headquarters," Matt heard Jameson call to the
driver of the cab.</p>

<p>A suspicion darted through Matt's brain. Jameson,
having secured his certified check, was losing little time
putting through his deal for the Hawk. Had his remark
about dropping in on the chief sometime during afternoon
been merely a "bluff"?</p>

<p>There was no other cab in sight, and several long
blocks lay between Matt and the chief's office. Jameson
was bound to reach police headquarters before Matt could
possibly arrive there.</p>

<p>For a minute, Matt stood in front of the bank, racking
his brains; then, as a swift counterstroke came to him,
he darted across the street to a corner drug store.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MATT SCORES AGAINST JAMESON.</p>


<p>What Matt had in mind when he raced across the
street was the telephone booth in the drug store. He
would call up the chief on the telephone.</p>

<p>The chief was a good friend of Matt's. In fact, Motor
Matt, because of the plucky and successful work he had
done, stood pretty high with the South Chicago police
department.</p>

<p>After a hurried examination of the telephone directory,
the young motorist called up the chief's office.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said he. "Is Chief Raymond there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," some one answered at the other end of the
wire. "Want to talk with him personally?"</p>

<p>"Got to, and right away."</p>

<p>"He's busy just now. Leave your message and I'll see
that he gets it."</p>

<p>"Can't. This is important and I'm in the biggest kind
of a hurry. Tell the chief Matt King&mdash;Motor Matt&mdash;wants
a word with him."</p>

<p>"Oh! Is that you, Matt? Why didn't you say so
at the start off? This is Harris. Couldn't you recognize
my voice?"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Jameson there, Harris?"</p>

<p>"He's just gettin' out of a cab, in front&mdash;I can see him
through the window."</p>

<p>"Well, please call the chief; I want to talk to him
before Jameson gets a chance."</p>

<p>A low whistle floated along the wire.</p>

<p>"All right," answered Harris.</p>

<p>It seemed to Matt as though he waited in that hot
telephone box for an hour, although it could not have
been more than a minute or two. He was now as eager
to get ahead of Jameson in the deal for the Hawk as were
Ferral and Carl.</p>

<p>Finally the chief's voice came over the phone.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Matt. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I want to buy that air ship, chief," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, boy! You haven't any money to throw
away, have you?"</p>

<p>"I should say not, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, forget it. You'd have about as much use for
that flying machine as a pig for two tails. Just wait a
second&mdash;here's Jameson, the fellow you had out in the
Hawk, waiting to talk with me. I'll call you up in a
few&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, wait a minute," cried Matt. "Jameson's got
three thousand he's going to pay for the Hawk. I'll give
thirty-five hundred, and put half the amount in your
hands inside of fifteen minutes. The rest will be here as
soon as I can get it from Chicago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not going to let you squander your money in any
such fool way," was the chief's astonishing response.
"I've got your best interests too much at heart, my lad."</p>

<p>"Look here," and Matt's voice took on a steely note,
"I'm not so young, chief, that I don't know what I'm
doing. I can see a good many chances to make money
with the Hawk, and if you keep me from getting the air
ship you'll be cutting a big hole in my prospects. Besides,
you've got to sell to the highest bidder, and I'm
giving you five hundred more than Jameson offers. Not
only that, but only part of the purchase money is mine.
I've got a partner in the deal, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>From a click and a sudden silence on the wire, Matt
knew that "central" had cut him off. Throwing the receiver
onto the hooks, he rang the bell frantically. After
two or three minutes, "central" answered him, begged his
pardon for cutting him off, and once more gave him the
chief's office.</p>

<p>Harris answered the phone again.</p>

<p>"Where's the chief, Harris?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"In his private room, Matt, talking with Jameson,"
came the officer's reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm coming right over there," said Matt.
"Please find out if the chief will see me when I arrive.
You can tell me when I reach headquarters."</p>

<p>"I guess he'll see you, all right."</p>

<p>Matt entered the big stone building in less than ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Harris met him with a wide and wondering grin.</p>

<p>"You've bought something, Matt," said he.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Jameson just left, and he was considerably worked up.
He said he hadn't any idea that you were bidding over
him, and that he had stood ready to offer five thousand
for the Hawk before letting the machine get away from
him."</p>

<p>"What did the chief say?"</p>

<p>"Why, that if you didn't show up inside of fifteen
minutes, with half the purchase money, Jameson could
have the air ship."</p>

<p>The young motorist drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "right here is where I deliver the
goods."</p>

<p>He walked into the chief's office, and found that official
smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>"Here's the money, chief," said Matt, laying the bills
down on the table. "I can give you a check for the balance,
or I'll go to Chicago and get the cash."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what you're doing, Matt," returned
the chief, "but I'll be hanged if I do. First off,
you'll have to have a place to keep the Hawk, and you
know Brady sold that old balloon house before he skipped
out, and the place is to be pulled down in a few days."</p>

<p>"I've figured out how I can have a light canvas shelter
made and carry it along in the car," said Matt.</p>

<p>"But what are you going to do with the machine?"
went on the chief curiously.</p>

<p>"Give exhibitions at state and county fairs, compete for
aëronautical prizes, perhaps, and after I and my partner
have had all the fun we want to with the Hawk, we'll
sell it to the government."</p>

<p>"You're buying a pig in a poke, Matt, but that's your
lookout. The Hawk is yours, and I guess I know you
well enough to take your check. When do you want
possession?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon or to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Better make it to-morrow morning. It will take this
afternoon to get the necessary papers from the court."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Will you let your officers guard the
Hawk until to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"I'll keep two men at the balloon house until you show
up there to claim your property."</p>

<p>"Thank you, chief. Just give me a receipt for that
cash and the check saying the money is in payment for
the air ship Hawk and that I'm to have the necessary
papers completing the transfer as soon as you can get
them."</p>

<p>This business formality was quickly carried out, and
when Matt left the chief's office, his Chicago bank account
looked as though it had been sandbagged. But Matt had
the chief's agreement in his pocket, and his heart was
light and his hopes buoyant.</p>

<p>Carl and Ferral were waiting for him in the hotel
office.</p>

<p>"The Hawk belongs to us, Dick," announced Matt, and
both Carl and Ferral began to rejoice. "We've got to
take possession to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The quicker the better!" cried Ferral.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do with the machine?"</p>

<p>"Do?" gasped Ferral blankly. "Why, fly in it, of
course! Navigate the skies."</p>

<p>"We can't be in the skies all the time. We'll have to
come down once in awhile, for gasoline, if for nothing
else, and for gas. Where are we going to keep the Hawk
while she's on the ground?"</p>

<p>"Hitch her to a tree," suggested Ferral. "It's easy
enough to find moorings for such a craft."</p>

<p>"But, if there's a storm, the Hawk will have to be protected."</p>

<p>"Py shinks," muttered Carl, "dere iss more to der
pitzness as vat I t'ought."</p>

<p>Ferral had bought a new outfit of shoes, hats, and
clothes for himself and Carl. Ferral's sailor rig was being
dried and pressed, and he had managed to pick up a
sailorman's hat, in lieu of the one he had lost on the
<i>Christina</i>.</p>

<p>Matt's logical remarks impressed Ferral quite as much
as Carl.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, with a grim laugh, "owning an air
ship ain't all beer and skittles. The best thing for us to
do is to keep traveling with it. At night, we'll berth the
thing in some farmer's barn, and we'll spend the day fanning
along through the air."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of barns big enough to house the
Hawk," returned Matt, "but I don't know where you'll
find a barn, in the whole country, with a big enough door
to take it in. And when you talk about traveling, Dick,
where'll we go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere, mate, it's all one to me until I'm ready
for Quebec."</p>

<p>"It costs money to travel by air ship. We've got to
buy oil and gasoline, and gas, too, now and then.
Wherever we travel, we've got to have the idea of profit
in mind. How about going to New York and hiring the
air ship to some one out on Coney Island?"</p>

<p>"Fine-o!" applauded Ferral. "You're overhauling the
right idea, at last, messmate. I knew we could trust you
to do that."</p>

<p>"Pully!" cried Carl. "Ve vill show off der machine
at Goney Islandt, und make so mooch money ve von't
know vat to do mit it. Hoop-a-la!"</p>

<p>Just then a bell boy came hurriedly up to Matt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're wanted on the phone," said he. "Police headquarters
is callin' fer you."</p>

<p>Matt and his chums had a distressful feeling that something
had gone wrong with the air-ship deal, and that the
chief was calling up to tell Matt to come back and get
his money. All three of them hurried to the telephone
booth.</p>

<p>While Matt was talking, Carl and Ferral hung about
the door of the booth, wrestling morbidly with their
doubts and fears.</p>

<p>"The air ship is still ours," laughed Matt, as he came
out of the booth, "but Grove, one of the gang that worked
with Brady, and who was captured and in jail here awaiting
trial, has escaped. What's more, the Chicago police
haven't been able to find that sailboat and catch the
Bradys. The chief here thinks Grove has gone to join
Hector Brady, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt paused.</p>

<p>"Go on, mate," urged Ferral.</p>

<p>"And that Carl and I had better look out," finished
Matt, "or Brady and his gang will put us out of the
way."</p>

<p>"Dey vill haf more as dey can do keeping oudt oof
der vay oof der bolice deirselufs," said Carl, "to bodder
mit us, Matt."</p>

<p>"That's the way I size it up, Carl," returned Matt.
"Besides, if Brady and his gang want to find us, after to-morrow
morning, they'll have to get hold of another air
ship."</p>

<p>But, even then, the cunning Brady was engineering a
plot which was to strike Matt and his chums like a bolt
from the blue.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AT THE BALLOON HOUSE.</p>


<p>Late that afternoon Matt and Carl went into Chicago
on the train. The young motorist had to sever his connection
with the Lestrange people, who were the eastern
representatives of the Jarrot Automobile Company, for
whom Matt had won the Borden cup during the recent
Kansas race.</p>

<p>While Matt was at the office of the Lestrange Company,
Carl was to go to the boarding house, settle their
bill, and get their baggage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dick Ferral went to the balloon house to
keep watch over the Hawk with the two officers on
guard there.</p>

<p>The Lestrange people were more than sorry to lose
Matt's services. There was no driver who could get
more speed out of a racing car than Motor Matt, and it
was largely his driving that had won the five-day race
at the Coliseum for the Jarrot car. Matt agreed, before
he left the Lestrange offices, that if ever he drove in another
race, he would give the Lestrange and Jarrot people
first chance to secure his services. Then, with his back
pay in his pocket, he made his way to the Twelfth Street
Station, met Carl with the luggage, and they returned to
South Chicago.</p>

<p>Matt and Carl went to the hotel to stay all night, and
the two officers who had been on duty at the balloon
house, having been relieved by a fresh detail, came in
about nine in the evening and informed Matt that Ferral
was going to stay at the balloon house until morning.</p>

<p>"Verral is afraidt der machine vill fly avay mit itseluf,"
chuckled Carl.</p>

<p>"It's all right to be on the safe side," said Matt. "I
guess that there won't be anything happen to the Hawk,
with two policemen and Dick to look after her."</p>

<p>"Sure nod," agreed Carl. "Vere vill Ferral shleep?"</p>

<p>"There's a small sleeping room in the back of the big
shed. Brady used to spend his nights there when he had
the air ship under the roof. There's a fixture in the room
for supplying the Hawk with illuminating gas. Brady
used to manufacture hydrogen, but since the police department
has had charge of the air ship, the supply of
gas has come from the city gas works. Oh, Dick will
be comfortable enough, out there, and when we join him
in the morning we'll take his breakfast along."</p>

<p>It was the intention of the three chums to start on their
long journey to New York the following morning. Matt
had bought a compass and a number of maps covering
the country they would cross. For a long time he sat
up, studying the maps and figuring on the towns at which
they would stop during their flight. It was nearly midnight
when he went to bed, and Carl had been snoring
for several hours.</p>

<p>Both boys were up bright and early. They ate a hearty
breakfast, and Matt had a meal packed away in a box
for Dick. It was about half-past six when they were
ready to start for the balloon house, and Matt suddenly
remembered that the papers completing the transfer of the
air ship had not come from the chief.</p>

<p>"I'll go on out to the balloon house with my satchel
and the box of grub for Dick," said Matt, "and you go
to police headquarters, Carl, and ask the chief for the
papers he was to get for me. If the chief isn't there yet,
see Harris. It may be you'll have to go to the chief's
house."</p>

<p>"All righdt," answered Carl, "schust so you don'd fly
avay und leaf me."</p>

<p>"You can bet we won't do that, Carl. We'll wait until
you get there before we start."</p>

<p>The two chums separated in front of the hotel, Carl
walking rapidly toward police headquarters, and Matt
turning toward the outskirts of the town and striding
away in the direction of the black smoke from the rolling
mills.</p>

<p>Ferral, once more in his sailor rig, was out in front of
the balloon house, and gave a yell when he saw Matt
coming down the road.</p>

<p>Matt dropped the satchel and lunch box over the fence
at the roadside, jumped after them, and then started
across the swampy stretch of ground.</p>

<p>"Ahoy, old raggie!" whooped Ferral, whose enthusiasm
seemed to have grown during the night. "Our ship's
pulling at her cables, just as though she's as anxious to
get away as we are. Where's Carl?"</p>

<p>"I sent him to the police department after those papers
the chief was to get for us," replied Matt. "Here's some
breakfast for you, Dick. Better get on the outside of it
as soon as you can. By the way, haven't you some luggage
in Chicago you'll want to get?"</p>

<p>"I sent all my luggage through to Quebec. When I
travel, Matt, I always travel light. Mighty nice of you
to remember my 'scran,'" Ferral added, as he took the
box Matt handed him.</p>

<p>While he was eating, the two officers came around the
end of the building.</p>

<p>"Our orders was to pull out as soon as you got here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
King," said one of them. "You're goin' to leave purty
soon, anyhow, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as we can get the Hawk out of the shed.
Our Dutch pard will be here by that time."</p>

<p>"I'd like to stay and see you off, but the old woman'll
have my breakfast ready, an' there's always a row if I
don't get there while it's hot. Good-by, an' good luck to
you."</p>

<p>"The same to you, officer."</p>

<p>The policeman started off toward the road, and Matt
went around to the front of the balloon house to open the
doors. The doors comprised almost the whole end of the
building, and when they were open, the interior of the
shed was well lighted by the sun.</p>

<p>The Hawk seemed fit and ready for any work she
might be called upon to do. As Matt looked at the great
swaying bag, the light car and its trim machinery, he experienced
a pride in the air ship he had never before
known. This was because the Hawk belonged partly to
him, now.</p>

<p>While in the balloon house, the air ship was not moored
with ropes, but was weighted down with sand bags hung
to the under side of the car. A pull of a lever would release
all the sand bags.</p>

<p>There was a supply of gasoline in the shed, and also
a small amount of oil. Matt filled the gasoline tank and
the oil tank, saw that all ropes belonging to the car were
safely stowed, and that propeller and steering rudder
were working properly.</p>

<p>By the time he had finished his survey, Ferral had got
through with his breakfast and had joined him.</p>

<p>"See anything of Carl, Dick?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"He wasn't in sight when I came in," replied Ferral.</p>

<p>"Probably the chief wasn't at his office and Carl had
to go to his house. He'll be along pretty soon, though.
It's a fine morning for the start. Hardly a breath of air
stirring."</p>

<p>Matt stowed his maps and compass in a little locker
close to the driver's chair.</p>

<p>"We've got to have a compass, eh?" grinned Ferral.</p>

<p>"It's just as well to have one," said Matt.</p>

<p>"And charts! Keelhaul me, mate, but this is just like
putting to sea in a ship."</p>

<p>"It's about the same thing."</p>

<p>"Only when we make landfall we drop to it. But
what's the good of the charts? We'll be off soundings
all the time, and no danger of bouncing up on a reef."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing to keep track of the towns we pass.
If we need gas, we want to be able to figure on reaching
a town big enough to supply it."</p>

<p>"Right-o, mate. I'll lay a month's pay your head's
level on the whole business, and that you've figured out
everything connected with the cruise. Are we going to
follow the railroad?"</p>

<p>"Not much, Dick! We're going to strike a bee line for
where we want to go. That's the beauty of traveling in
an air ship. You don't have to go around a mountain,
or hunt for a place to cross a stream."</p>

<p>"Strike me lucky, mate," jubilated Ferral, rubbing his
hands, "I'm mighty glad I stopped over in Chicago to
see you, and that we were able to get our hooks on this
air ship. The way the thing fell out, it seems like that
was how it was meant to be. Everything that's happened
has steered us both for the Hawk. If I hadn't dropped
into that trap Brady, Jr., laid for me, I wouldn't have
been out in the lake; and if you hadn't come along in the
Hawk, just when you did, I couldn't have saved my
money; and if you hadn't picked me up, money and all,
that other lubber would have got ahead of us and grabbed
the air ship. Oh, we've been main lucky, all around."</p>

<p>"What will your uncle say," quizzed Matt, "when you
write him you have bought an interest in an air ship?"</p>

<p>"Bless the old chap! Why, matey, anything I do is
all right for Uncle Jack. If I'd bought a menagerie, or
a steam calliope, the old boy would have clapped me on
the shoulder and said I'd done well."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Matt, "that's mighty nice&mdash;for you.
Suppose we get the Hawk out of the shed? By the time
we do that, Carl ought to be here."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, my hearty! How do you go to work to
warp the craft out of her berth? You'll have to tell me
what to do, until I can learn the ropes."</p>

<p>"All we've got to do," said Matt, "is just to take hold
of the car and pull the air ship through the door. These
sand bags hold her steady. Be careful, though, that the
gas bag don't strike the side of the door. It would cost
us a lot of money, and delay us for a week or two, if we
were unlucky enough to rip the fabric."</p>

<p>By working carefully, the boys got the front part of the
Hawk through the end of the shed and into the open
air. Matt was at the front of the car, and Ferral was at
the rear. While the young motorist bent to his work, he
heard a noise as of running feet.</p>

<p>Straightening himself quickly, he whirled around. Four
roughly dressed men were rushing at him from the corner
of the shed. The rascals were plainly hostile, as their
clinched fists and their scowling faces proved. One of
the scoundrels, who was within arm's length of Matt,
halted and aimed a blow at him. Matt deftly evaded the
blow. By then the others were near enough to take part
in the set-to.</p>

<p>"This way, Dick!" yelled Motor Matt, as he struck
down one of the ruffians.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE PLOT OF THE BRADY GANG.</p>


<p>The attack of the four men had been engineered with a
suddenness that took Matt's breath. The men were not
common hoodlums, although they looked the part, but all
four of them were men whom Matt recognized.</p>

<p>They were all members of the Brady gang. One was
Grove, who had escaped from the South Chicago authorities
on the preceding afternoon; another was Harper, who
used to drive the Hawk for Brady when the air ship was
in his possession; another man was Pete, and the fourth
was Whipple.</p>

<p>Matt had seen a picture of Harper in the "rogues'
gallery" in the chief's office, and he had had no difficulty
in recognizing the rascal at a glance. Harper had been
with Grove at the time some blue prints were stolen from
Hamilton Jerrold, another inventor of air ships, living in
South Chicago. But Harper had been hurt in Jerrold's
house and had not got away in the air ship, which the
thieves had used to help them commit their robbery.</p>

<p>Pete and Whipple had been with Brady in a rendezvous
in Willoughby's swamp, near Lake Station, Indiana. Matt
had had some exciting dealings with Grove, Pete, and
Whipple, and knew them fairly well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferral, hearing Matt's cry and the rush of feet, had
run out of the shed and around the front of the car. As
quickly as he could, he leaped to Matt's assistance.</p>

<p>But what could the two boys accomplish against four
husky men, all desperately determined to carry out the
plot they had formed? Officers of the law were hunting
for all of them, and if they did not succeed in their nefarious
work, it would not be many hours before they saw
the inside of a prison cell.</p>

<p>Matt King never fought better than he did then. He
had struck down Whipple, and had thrown himself at
Pete.</p>

<p>About the same time, Ferral engaged Grove. Grove
had science as well as strength, and was keeping Ferral
pretty well occupied.</p>

<p>Whipple, wild with fury, staggered to his feet. He
was behind Matt, and Ferral, out of the corner of his
eye, saw him preparing to strike.</p>

<p>"Look out, mate!" warned Ferral. "There's a big swab
behind you!"</p>

<p>But the warning came too late. Whipple's ham-like
fist reached Matt's head, and the young motorist staggered
and flung up his arms. Again the enraged Whipple
aimed a blow, but Matt dropped to one side, and the fist
only grazed his shoulder. Pete, however, had been watching
his chance. Throwing himself forward, he dealt a
fierce blow with his fist that toppled Matt to the ground.</p>

<p>Harper, meantime, had come up behind Ferral and successfully
carried out the same man&oelig;uvre that had been
made use of by Whipple. Both boys were brutally
knocked off their feet. The moment they were down,
Harper fell on Ferral and Pete dropped on Matt, when
Whipple turned on Grove.</p>

<p>"Go ter the side o' the shed, Grove," said he, "an' keep
yer eyes skinned along the road. If ye see anyone
comin', jest let out a yell."</p>

<p>"What's the use of fooling around here any longer?"
demanded Grove. "We've got the car, and all we have
to do now is to get into her and let the police look up at
us."</p>

<p>"Do as I tell ye!" bawled Whipple. "Our work ain't
done yet. The ole man told us what ter do with King,
an' we're goin' ter do it. He's played hob with Brady's
plans, an' the ole man is crazy ter git even. T'other
chap, bein' with King, 'll have ter stand fer the same
dose."</p>

<p>Grove, muttering to himself, moved off toward the
corner of the balloon house. Whipple, hurrying to the
car, took out a coil of rope. It was not heavy rope, but
fine and pliable.</p>

<p>Cutting off four pieces of the rope, Whipple went to
Matt. The young motorist was still dazed from the
blows he had received, and it was not difficult for Pete
to hold him while Whipple tied his wrists at his back
and his feet at the ankles.</p>

<p>Thereupon Whipple passed to Dick and secured him
in the same way.</p>

<p>"Anyone in sight yet, Grove?" Whipple asked as he
straightened up.</p>

<p>"No," replied Grove.</p>

<p>"Well, keep yer eyes peeled. We're a good ways from
bein' through." He turned to Harper and Pete. "Lay
holt o' the car, you two," he ordered, "an' pull the Hawk
clear o' the shed. Mind ye don't let the gas bag tech the
sides o' the door."</p>

<p>"This ain't the first time I've helped with the Hawk,"
said Harper. "I reckon I know how ter handle her as
well as anyone."</p>

<p>Harper and Pete managed to get the air ship out of
the shed without injury. This left the opening into the
shed clear.</p>

<p>"You two," Whipple went on to Pete and Harper,
"pick up that other feller an' kerry him in. I can handle
King, all right."</p>

<p>The way Whipple handled Matt was to grab him by
the collar and drag him through the door and the length
of the shed. At the end of the big room he opened a
door and pulled Matt into a small chamber not more than
ten feet square by as many high&mdash;hardly more than a big
box. There was a window in one wall, and two cots at
each side.</p>

<p>Halting in front of one of the cots, Whipple picked
Matt up in his arms and dumped him upon the narrow
bed.</p>

<p>"Put your kid on the other cot," ordered Whipple to
Harper and Pete.</p>

<p>Ferral was lifted and placed as the leader of the gang
had directed.</p>

<p>Matt had been conscious of every move that was made,
although his mind had not been at all clear. By the time
he had been placed on the cot, however, his faculties were
as keen as ever, in spite of the pain he suffered on account
of his rough treatment.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do, Whipple?" he demanded,
turning his head so he could look directly into the face of
the leader of the gang.</p>

<p>"What we're tryin' ter do we've as good as done," was
the fierce answer. "We're undoin' the thing you done a
week er more ago. The perlice are after us, on account
o' you, an' we're goin' ter make a getaway in the Hawk."</p>

<p>"The Hawk belongs to me and my friend, on the other
cot."</p>

<p>"How d'ye figger that out? I reckoned the Hawk belonged
ter Brady."</p>

<p>"Brady is a thief. He stole a lot of stuff, and the
Hawk was sold to help pay back the losses of some of the
people who were robbed."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" laughed Whipple, huskily, "that's the way
of it, eh? An' you an' yer chum bought the Hawk?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If you steal her you'll get into trouble&mdash;a lot
more trouble than you're in already. I guess you've got
more now than you can take care of."</p>

<p>"An' it was you as made the trouble fer us!" cried
Whipple, with a black scowl, stepping closer to Matt and
shaking a fist in his face. "But you're right at the end o'
your rope, my buck. Brady never fergits a feller who
crosses his plans like you done. Arter we leave here it
won't be you that makes the trouble fer us."</p>

<p>"Is Brady in this?" queried Matt, seeking information.</p>

<p>"He's on deck, you bet, an' we're goin' ter pick him
up close ter Willoughby's swamp; then we're goin' ter
cross the lake an' come down in a place where we'll be
safe fer a spell. While we got the Hawk we're safe from
the perlice, all right, but we got our operations ter attend
to."</p>

<p>"More robbery, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Suppose what ye blam' please, ye'll never be able ter
tell anyone what ye're hearin' from me now. What we're
goin' ter do to you an' yer chum'll teach others ter let
Hector Brady an' his gang alone. If I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then a shrill whistle came to the ears of those in
the little room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen to that!" exclaimed Pete, in consternation.</p>

<p>"Somebody's comin'!" gasped Harper. "If we don't
make a run out of this we'll be nabbed."</p>

<p>Whipple jumped to a gas bracket against one of the
rough board walls. It was not an ordinary bracket, but
had a wide mouth to which a piece of hose could be attached.
This had been used by the police officials to replenish
the gas in the silk envelope of the Hawk.</p>

<p>With one jerk of his hand Whipple turned the gas full
on.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he called to the two with him.</p>

<p>Pete and Harper tumbled through the door into the
shed. Whipple hurried after them but paused a moment
on the threshold to give a wild, taunting laugh.</p>

<p>"That's what Brady told us ter do," said he, savagely,
"an' we've done it. Git clear o' this, if ye can!"</p>

<p>With that, Whipple slammed the door.</p>

<p>The fate to which the murderous scoundrel had consigned
the two boys was a fearful one. Even as the door
closed, Matt could smell the odor of gas pouring into the
small room and poisoning the air.</p>

<p>"Dick!" he called. "Can you hear me? Do you know
what has been going on?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, old ship," came from Ferral. "We're bound
for Jones', as straight as we can go. We've lost the
Hawk, and probably we've lost our lives. Hard luck!"</p>

<p>"Hard luck!" exclaimed Matt. "Why, Dick, it's the
hardest luck I ever had come my way. But there's a
chance."</p>

<p>"What sort of a chance, mate? I can't see any."</p>

<p>"Grove, one of the gang, was left outside to watch.
He was to whistle if anyone came along the road. Didn't
you hear him give the warning? If anyone is coming, we
can bring them here. Use your lungs, pard! Yell for all
you're worth! Our lives may depend on it!"</p>

<p>Fighting frenziedly to free themselves of the ropes
about their hands, the boys shouted at the top of their
voices for help. They could feel the vitiated air of the
room bringing their breath short and hard, and they knew
that their voices were getting feebler by degrees.
Desperately they continued to call, hoping against hope
that they would be heard, and that some one would come
to their aid before it was too late.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CARL IS SURPRISED.</p>


<p>Carl, when he left the hotel to call on the chief in accordance
with Motor Matt's instructions, left his satchel
in care of the clerk. In going to the balloon house, after
he had transacted his business at police headquarters, he
would have to return past the hotel, and by leaving the
satchel he would not have to bother with it during his call
on the chief.</p>

<p>It was very early, too early for the chief to be in his
office. Nor was Harris at headquarters. No one there
knew of any papers that had been left for Matt.</p>

<p>Carl was disappointed, for he was in a hurry to rejoin
his friends at the balloon house. Nevertheless, Matt had
told him to be sure and see the chief, and so Carl inquired
his way to that official's house.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the house, Carl found that the chief
had left and gone to headquarters; so the disgusted German
turned around and made his way back to the chief's
office. The head of the department had not yet arrived
there, having been delayed somewhere on the road.</p>

<p>Carl had to wait half an hour. When the chief finally
came, Carl got to him at once and asked about the papers.
"They're here, all right," smiled the official. "I would
have sent them to Matt last night, only I was so busy
trying to find that escaped prisoner, Grove, that the matter
slipped my mind. You lads are going to start off in the
air ship, are you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered the impatient Carl, "oof I efer ged
dose bapers and meet Matt like vat he saidt. I don'd vant
dem fellers to go off mitoudt me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they won't do that! Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Py New York. Anyhow, dot vas our bresent indentions."</p>

<p>"New York? Great Scott! Do you think that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I vas in a pig hurry, chief," interrupted Carl, wildly.
"You see, I haf peen more as an hour looking for you,
und I vas vay late meeding Matt und Tick. Oof you vill
blease handt ofer dose bapers, I vill shlide oudt so kevick
as bossiple."</p>

<p>The chief pulled a sealed envelope from a pigeonhole
in his desk and handed it to Carl.</p>

<p>"There you are," said he. "If Matt hears anything
about Brady, or the rest of his gang, tell him to be sure
and let me know."</p>

<p>"He vill do dot, you bed you. He iss as anxious to haf
Brady captured as anypody."</p>

<p>"He ought to be. Brady will do everything he can to
get even with Matt for the havoc Matt has played with
the gang. And that's what leads me to believe Matt may
see something of him. Tell your friend that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Carl waited for no more. He had already lost
more time than he could well afford.</p>

<p>Bolting out of the chief's office, he made a rush for
the hotel. There he secured his satchel and started along
the road toward the rolling mills.</p>

<p>The drops rolled off Carl's face as he hurried. As soon
as he struck the beginning of the road that ran past the
swampy meadow, he kept his eyes in the direction of the
balloon house. It was several minutes before he sighted
the big building, and then it was far off and could be
seen only indistinctly.</p>

<p>Swiftly he drew nearer and nearer. As the building
came more prominently into view, he was able to make
out the air ship, swaying in front.</p>

<p>"Dey haf got der Hawk oudt oof der house!" he muttered.
"Dey're alretty to go, und dey vas only vaiting
for me."</p>

<p>Even as Carl was congratulating himself on the fact
that he was not going to be left behind, he was astounded
to see the Hawk move upward and away from the balloon
house. He was still so far away that he could not see
those in the car, and a terrific fear shivered along his
nerves.</p>

<p>"Himmelblitzen!" he groaned, "I vouldn't haf t'ought
it bossiple! Dey vas leafing me in der lurch. Modor
Matt, der pest friendt vat I efer hat, iss skyhooting avay
mitoudt his Dutch bard! Vat iss der meaning oof dot?"</p>

<p>For a few moments Carl stood rooted to the ground.
Then he had an idea.</p>

<p>"Meppy Matt und Tick vas coming pack tovards town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to pick me oop!" he murmured, and continued to stand
still and watch.</p>

<p>But the Hawk did not turn around and come in Carl's
direction. On the contrary, it kept moving off toward
the south and west.</p>

<p>"Ach, vat a pad pitzness!" groaned Carl. "Matt!" he
yelled, as loud as he could, starting to run along the road
and waving his satchel as he went, "vy don'd you vait for
your Dutch pard, Matt? Haf you gone back on me?"</p>

<p>If Carl's voice had been strong enough to reach a mile,
his yelling might have ascended to the ears of those in the
car. As it was, however, Carl might as well have shouted
into the empty air. But he was excited, and hardly knew
what he was about.</p>

<p>When he came opposite the balloon house he hardly
gave it a look; and he was making so much noise himself
that he was unable to hear the calls coming from the
small addition in the rear of the big shed.</p>

<p>On and on along the road went Carl, keeping up his
frenzied pace. He got beyond the big mills, and then,
after he had got past the smoke from their huge chimneys,
he saw that the air ship had disappeared. Utterly dejected,
and tired out with his hard run, he sat down on
a rock near the roadside.</p>

<p>"I nefer vouldt haf t'ought dot oof Modor Matt," he
wheezed mournfully. "All along I haf hat some hunches
dot I vouldn't ged avay in dot air ship py New York.
Vell, vell! Der pest friendt vat I efer hat has vent pack
on me, und I vas a shdray Dutchman mit fife tollars in
my bocket und no blace to go."</p>

<p>While Carl mused in this lugubrious strain, a girl came
toward him along the road. Her clothes were dusty,
and her face was haggard. She was pretty, in spite of
her weariness and her coarse clothes, and there was a
dauntless gleam in her dark eyes. When she came close
to Carl she paused.</p>

<p>Carl pulled off his hat.</p>

<p>"Vas you in some drouples, too, miss?" he asked. "Oof
you vas, den ve ought to be some pooty goot gompany.
Misery lofes gompany, dey say, und I vas so full oof
misery as I can't dell."</p>

<p>The girl stared at him wonderingly for a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you acquainted with the country around here?"
she asked. "I ought to know it, but I never came into
South Chicago before by this road."</p>

<p>"Vell, I know somet'ing aboudt it," replied Carl. "For
vy do you make dose inkviries?"</p>

<p>"I'm looking for the balloon house where they keep
the air ship called the Hawk," was the astounding reply.</p>

<p>Carl leaped off the stone as though he had been touched
by a live wire.</p>

<p>"Sure I know dot!" he cried. "Vat for do you vant
to know?"</p>

<p>"I must hurry and get there," answered the girl. "I've
walked a long ways, and I'm pretty tired, but I've got to
reach the balloon house."</p>

<p>"Der Hawk don'd vas dere any more," said Carl.</p>

<p>The girl clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that the Hawk has been taken away
so soon?"</p>

<p>"Vell, she don'd vas oxactly daken. You see, der
bard vat I hat has gone pack on me und he skyhooted
off mit der Hawk, leafing me behindt."</p>

<p>"When was this?" asked the girl, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Schust a leedle vile ago. Ter Hawk only schust got
oudt oof sight. Couldn't you see it? Oof you hat looked
oop you vould sure haf seen der air ship."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the girl, tearfully, "then I'm too late! And
I tried so hard to get here. I hadn't any money, you see,
and I had to walk."</p>

<p>"How far haf you valked?"</p>

<p>"All the way from Lake Station."</p>

<p>"Ach, chimineddy! Dot vas too pad, I bed you. Who
you vas? I haf fife tollars, und you can haf dot."</p>

<p>Carl pulled the crumpled bill out of his pocket and tried
to push it into the girl's hand. But she would not take it.</p>

<p>"No, no," said she. "My name is Helen Brady, and
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl grew rigid. His amazement was growing.</p>

<p>"Vy," he cried, "den you vas Prady's daughter, eh?
Der vone vat heluped Modor Matt ged avay from Villoughy's
svamp mit der Hawk dot time he prought two
oof der gang indo Sout' Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," returned the girl. "I am the same Helen
Brady who helped Motor Matt. If the air ship is gone
from the balloon house, then it wasn't Matt who sailed
away with her, but four of my father's men."</p>

<p>Carl was electrified.</p>

<p>"Ach, I ditn't t'ink my olt bard, Modor Matt, could
dreat me in sooch a vay as dot!" he exclaimed. "Vat has
pecome oof Matt und Verral?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," answered the girl. "I'm afraid
that some awful trouble has come to them. We must
hurry to the balloon house and see."</p>

<p>"Yah, you bed you!" cried Carl. "Meppy I can gif
you some helup on der vay? You vas more tired as me&mdash;und
you valked from Lake Station! Himmelblitzen!
vat you t'ink oof dot! A leedle girl like you valk all der
vay from Lake Station! Come, und ve vill got togedder
py der palloon house."</p>

<p>Carrying his satchel in his left hand, with his right
Carl grasped the girl's arm and helped her along the
road. They did not proceed at a very rapid pace, but they
walked much faster than the girl could have done had
she been compelled to go on alone.</p>

<p>"Vat iss der drouple, anyvay?" asked Carl. "Vy you
vas valking to der palloon house?"</p>

<p>"There is a plot," answered the girl, "a plot to steal
the air ship and to do some harm to Motor Matt. Matt
helped me, that time he took the air ship away from the
swamp, and I want to help him. But I'm afraid I'm too
late, too late."</p>

<p>The girl's voice and manner all convinced Carl that
there was something very serious the matter. The theft
of the air ship would have been bad enough, in itself,
but there was a chance that harm had befallen Matt.</p>

<p>Excited and anxious, Carl toiled on along the road,
helping the girl and keeping his eyes on the balloon house,
just as he had done when he had approached it from the
direction of town&mdash;only he was even more wildly anxious
now than he was then.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HELEN BRADY'S CLUE.</p>


<p>Matt remembered the awful moment when he felt his
senses leaving him, when the interior of the bare little
room swam on his sight and was blotted out in a black
mist. After that he could remember nothing until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
opened his eyes in the bright sunlight, and saw the
strangely familiar face of a girl bending over him.</p>

<p>For a brief space his clearing senses grappled with the
situation helplessly; then, as the clear outer air drove
from his lungs the poison he had been breathing, his
faculties regained their normal condition.</p>

<p>"Helen Brady!" he mumbled, sitting up.</p>

<p>"Yah, you bed you!" whooped Carl, from a little distance
away. "Dot vas Helen Prady, Matt, und oof it
hatn't peen for her, you und Tick vould haf peen goners.
Helen Prady is a pooty fine girl, you bed you. I dake off
my hat to her any tay as you can findt in der veek. Miss
Prady," and Carl directed his admiring gaze at the girl,
"allow me to make some remarks dot you vas a brick&mdash;und
not a goldt brick, neider. She valked all der vay
from Lake Station, Matt, to safe you und Tick!"</p>

<p>Carl was near Ferral, who was likewise sitting up in
front of the balloon house, only a little way off.</p>

<p>"Sink me, mate," cried Ferral, "but we had a close call
of it. We shook hands with Davy Jones&mdash;just about&mdash;and
then Miss Brady and Carl pulled us away from him."</p>

<p>"I'm all twisted up about this," said Matt, rubbing a
hand across his eyes in a dazed way.</p>

<p>"I'm all ahoo over it myself," put in Ferral. "I'm glad
I'm alive, but I can't understand how Miss Brady got
here and helped us out of that scrape."</p>

<p>"Tell dem aboudt it, Miss Prady," urged Carl. "You
haf tone a mighdy fine t'ing, und Matt und Tick ought
to know all aboudt it."</p>

<p>"Ever since you got away from Willoughby's swamp
with the Hawk, Matt," said Helen, "I have been staying
in Lake Station. My father, and Pete, and Whipple got
out of the swamp by a secret way they knew about, very
soon after you left. Dad gave me some money and told
me to find a place to stay in Lake Station. He was terribly
ugly to me, and I was glad that I was going to be
free from him for a while. There was a woman in the
village who had some furnished rooms to rent, and I
rented them and stayed there. I didn't see anything of
dad until last night. I was in the other part of the house,
visiting the woman who owned it, and when I went back
to my rooms I saw a light shining through a window
between the edge of the curtain and the sill. I listened
and heard voices&mdash;then I knew that dad had found the
place where I was staying, and had come there.</p>

<p>"There was a way to get into the cellar, and I got into
it and crept up a stairway without being heard. By sitting
at the top of the stairs I could listen and hear all
that was said.</p>

<p>"Whipple was in the room with dad, and they were
talking over a scheme for getting hold of the Hawk.
Officers of the law were hunting them, and, if they did
not have the air ship, they felt that they would not be
able to avoid arrest for very long.</p>

<p>"Whipple told dad how Grove had managed to escape
from the South Chicago police, and dad told Whipple
how he had been out in a sailboat with my brother, and
how they had tried to get some money from a young fellow
my brother had met on the train, and how Motor
Matt, with the Hawk, had come along just in time to
prevent the robbery. After that, my father said he and
my brother had the sailboat set them ashore. My father
had come to Lake Station, and had sent my brother to
tell Whipple to come to the same place. And that was
how the two happened to meet in my rooms.</p>

<p>"Whipple, Pete, and Harper had been in hiding in Willoughby's
swamp, and that was the place to which Grove
came when he made his escape.</p>

<p>"My father knew that the Hawk was being kept by
the police in the old balloon house, and that two officers
were constantly on guard to see that no harm came to the
machine. It was also known that Motor Matt was spending
a good deal of time at the balloon house and running
the air ship for the officers.</p>

<p>"Dad's plot centred about the balloon house. It was a
risky plot, but dad told Whipple they would all have to
take desperate chances if they hoped to succeed in stealing
the Hawk and getting away in her. Whipple agreed
with dad, and they arranged between them that Whipple,
Grove, Harper, and Pete were to get close to the balloon
house in the early morning, steal the Hawk, and sail
away. If they were successful, they were to stop at the
marsh for dad; and if they captured Motor Matt,
Whipple was to put him, securely bound, in the back
room, behind the shed, and turn on the gas there."</p>

<p>The girl shivered, and an expression of horror crossed
her face.</p>

<p>"I can't begin to tell you," she half sobbed, "how terribly
I felt. Motor Matt had helped me, and I could not
bear to think that my own father was&mdash;was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Helen paused, and it was a moment before she could
recover herself and go on.</p>

<p>"At first," she continued, "I thought of running into
the room where dad was and begging him not to let
Whipple harm Motor Matt. But a little thought showed
me that such a course would be foolish. Not only would
dad not listen to me, but he would probably make me a
prisoner, so as to keep me from interfering with his plot.
I had no money left, and the only thing I could do was to
walk to South Chicago, and try to get there before the
plot was carried out. I got my hat&mdash;it was in a bedroom
easily reached from the cellarway&mdash;and I started.</p>

<p>"I walked miles and miles through the darkness, and
at last I was so tired I had to sit down and rest. Then
I got up and started on again. Every little while I would
sit down for a few minutes. But I did not dare to stop
very long, for fear I would not get to South Chicago
in time.</p>

<p>"Morning came, and I guided myself by the smoke
from the rolling mills. Just as I was about to give out
entirely, I met Carl."</p>

<p>The girl turned her eyes toward the Dutch boy.</p>

<p>"Und it vas a pooty goot t'ing dot Miss Prady met me

<p>"Vell, dere vas my bard, Modor Matt, lying shdill on

Ach, it vas some habbiness for bot' oof us ven ve

<p>Matt and Dick had listened to all this with deep interest.
What most impressed them was the courage and
determination shown by Helen Brady. Matt reached out
and clasped her hand.</p>

<p>"You saved my life and Dick's," said he, with feeling,
"and that is something we'll never forget."</p>

<p>"Not if we live to be a thousand years old!" declared
Ferral. "You're a brave lass, Miss Brady, and I've an
uncle who won't forget what you've done, either."</p>

<p>"I only did what I thought I ought to do," said Helen.
"It was merely undoing a wrong of my father's, and it
was no more than right that I should do what I could."</p>

<p>"Ach, Matt," piped up Carl, "aber you vas blaying in
some hardt luck! Und shdill, mit all dot, vasn't it pooty
fine dot you got oudt oof dot tight blace mit your life,
you und Tick?"</p>

<p>"Right-o, matey!" agreed Ferral heartily. "Matt and
I, between us, have lost the Hawk, which means thirty-five
hundred, in cold cash, but, all the same, we ought
to shake hands over it and call ourselves well off."</p>

<p>Matt grabbed Dick's hand.</p>

<p>"Shake!" said he. "A fellow never has such a run
of hard luck but he can think a little and see where it
might have been a whole lot worse."</p>

<p>A puzzled look had come into Helen's face.</p>

<p>"How was it, Matt," she queried, "that you and your
friend lost so much money?"</p>

<p>Matt explained about the purchase of the air ship. As
Helen listened, her look of wonder changed to one of
distress.</p>

<p>"I am sorry!" she said, with a pang of deepest regret.
"I know where dad and the rest have gone, though, and
if you wanted to follow them, you might be able to get
the air ship back."</p>

<p>The information startled all three of the boys.</p>

<p>"You know that?" cried Matt, his face brightening.</p>

<p>"Yes. They are going to cross the lake to Grand
Haven. There's a man in Grand Haven that dad knows.
His name is Ochiltree, Dave Ochiltree. Dad is going to
see him. I don't know where the rest will be with the
Hawk, but no doubt you could find out from Ochiltree."</p>

<p>"It's a clue, and a good one!" said Matt. "We will
follow it, Helen."</p>

<p>"Aye, that we will!" exclaimed Ferral.</p>

<p>"You bed you!" averred Carl. "Sooch a goot luck as
dot iss vat ve vas looking for. Meppy ve follow der clue
und get der air ship pack, den make anoder shtart for
New York, hey?"</p>

<p>An idea came suddenly to Matt. Leaping to Carl, he
grabbed him by the arm.</p>

<p>"The Eagle," said he, speaking rapidly, "has chased
the Hawk before. Why not call on Hamilton Jerrold?"</p>

<p>Carl gave an exultant yell and tossed his cap.</p>

<p>"Dot's der fery t'ing, Matt!" he declared. "Oof dere
iss enyvone in der whole vorldt as vouldt like to do
Modor Matt a goot durn, it iss dot feller Jerrold! Led
us go to him righdt avay, ad vonce, mitoudt losing some

<p class="chaptitle">JERROLD GIVES HIS AID.</p>


<p>"You've got me in a monkey's fist again," spoke up
Ferral. "What's all this about the Eagle and Hamilton
Jerrold?"</p>

<p>"Don'd you rememper, Tick," said Carl, "I toldt you
aboudt dot odder feller in Sout' Chicago vat hat inventioned
an air ship? His ship iss der Eagle, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, mate, now I rise to you," interrupted Ferral.
"Fine idea, that of chasing one air craft with another.
The only point is, will this man Jerrold let Matt take his
air ship?"</p>

<p>"Dot feller vouldt do anyt'ing for Matt," averred Carl.
"Matt got pack der plue brints for him, und he t'inks der
King oof der Modor Poys iss der greadest feller vat efer
habbened."</p>

<p>"The quicker we can see Jerrold," suggested Matt,
"the sooner we shall know whether or not he can help
us. Not only that, but I've got to report the theft of the
air ship to the police."</p>

<p>"Who loses der air ship?" queried Carl. "Der bolice,
oder Matt und Tick?"</p>

<p>"Matt and Dick," answered Ferral. "We had bought
the machine, and if it had been stolen no more than a
minute after the money had been turned over, we would
still have been the ones to lose it. I don't know what
sort of case you're in, Matt, but I've got a head that feels
as big as a barrel. If I could soak it awhile in cold water
I think it would do it good."</p>

<p>"My head was pretty near knocked off my shoulders,"
answered Matt, "and then to inhale all that gas on top
of the pounding, gave us a whole lot to stand. Work is
what we need, Dick. If we can get busy we'll forget our
troubles."</p>

<p>The doors of the empty balloon house were closed,
Matt and Carl gathered up their satchels, and they started
back toward South Chicago, Ferral helping Helen Brady
over the road.</p>

<p>"Some beople vill be surbrised ad seeing us come in
valking mit ourselufs," observed Carl, "ven ve vas going
to rite der odder vay in der Hawk. Ve nefer know vone
minid vat iss going to happen der next."</p>

<p>This remark of Carl's was generally agreed to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to do now, Helen?" asked Matt,
dropping alongside the girl and Ferral. "Your father
has gone away and left you, and you will have to do
something for yourself."</p>

<p>"I know it," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"What has become of your brother?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he has gone. He may go across
the lake with dad, or he may stay in Chicago. When dad
talked with Whipple, I didn't hear him say what Hector
was to do."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing your father has left you, Helen,"
said Matt, "and if all I hear about your brother is true,
I hope he won't come around to bother you."</p>

<p>A sad look crossed the girl's face. With her father
and her brother both criminals, her position was forlorn,
indeed.</p>

<p>"I have friends in Chicago," said she, "and I could go
and stay with them for a time."</p>

<p>"That's the thing to do," approved Matt. Taking two
ten-dollar bills from his pocket, he forced them into the
girl's hand. "You've got to take the money," said he.
"Sometime, if you feel as though you ought to, you can
pay me back, but don't let the debt bother you."</p>

<p>"Here," called Ferral, diving into his own pocket and
bringing up some money, "I'm in on this."</p>

<p>"Und me, too," said Carl. "I vill dake five tollars'
vort'."</p>

<p>Helen thanked all the boys, with tears in her eyes, but
Matt's was the only money she would take.</p>

<p>"This will be enough for my immediate needs," said
she, "and while I am staying in Chicago, I can arrange
to get something to do."</p>

<p>By that time the little party was well into South Chicago.
The satchels were returned to the hotel, and Carl
was left with Helen, to take her to a restaurant where she
could get something to eat, and then to put her aboard a
train for Chicago. After that, Carl was to make his way
to Jerrold's house.</p>

<p>Matt and Dick, when they left their Dutch chum and
the girl, hurried to police headquarters.</p>

<p>When the chief saw Matt, he threw up his hands.</p>

<p>"Did your air ship give out on you?" he asked. "I
thought you were well on your way to New York by this
time."</p>

<p>What Matt had to say about the air ship nearly took
the chief's breath. Then, when he realized all that recent
events meant, his temper got the better of him.</p>

<p>"I've got a fine force of roundsmen and detectives,"
said he sarcastically, "when a pack of scoundrels we're
looking for can pull off a trick like that right in the outskirts
of town!"</p>

<p>Matt eased the chief's anger somewhat by telling him
of the clue they had received as to Brady's whereabouts,
and he explained how he and his friends were going to
get Jerrold's air ship and follow the clue across the lake.</p>

<p>"Now that sounds mighty good," said the chief, a
flicker of hope crossing his face, "and of course the
South Chicago police department ought to be represented
in the expedition. Suppose I send Harris, in plain
clothes, along with you? He knows St. Jo, Benton
Harbor, Grand Haven, and all those places across the
lake like a native. He'll be a help. Unless I'm mightily
mistaken, this man Ochiltree is an old-time crook, and has
served a term or two in the 'pen.' Anyhow, his name is
familiar to me. But you boys are in a hurry and I won't
detain you. Go on to Jerrold's. I'll have Harris get into
civilian's clothes and join you there."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, Matt and Dick were at the inventor's
rambling old house. Hamilton Jerrold himself
answered Matt's ring, caught him by the hand with the
utmost cordiality, and ushered him and Ferral into the
sitting room.</p>

<p>"It does my eyes good to see you again, Matt," beamed
Jerrold. "You've been making some fine flights with the
Hawk for the police department. Jupiter, but you're a
wonder when it comes to handling anything that's driven
with an explosive engine."</p>

<p>Matt flushed and made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p>"It seems, Mr. Jerrold," said he, "that I never call on
you except when I'm in trouble."</p>

<p>The inventor took fresh interest.</p>

<p>"You're in trouble now?" he asked, showing a good
deal of concern.</p>

<p>"I'm in the hardest kind of luck," went on Matt, and
he proceeded to explain how he and Ferral had bought
the Hawk, and how Brady had executed his balloon-house
plot, stolen the machine, and almost caused a tragedy.</p>

<p>Hamilton Jerrold had been himself entangled with
Brady and knew just what kind of a scoundrel he was.
His experience with Brady had left much bitterness in its
wake, and Jerrold was eager to do whatever he could
to bring the leader of the Brady gang to justice. Apart
from his own feelings in the matter, Jerrold felt that
Motor Matt had a claim on him.</p>

<p>"The Hawk," said Jerrold, "is a good machine, but
the Eagle is a better one. We can cross the lake in the
Eagle and land wherever you want to, and it is needless
for me to say, my boy, that both the air ship and myself
are at your service."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Jerrold," returned Matt gratefully.
"Is the Eagle ready for use?"</p>

<p>"During the last week Payne and I have been improving
her, and we did the very last tap on the car
yesterday. All we have to do is to fill the tanks and put
a little more gas in the bag&mdash;inside of an hour we can
start."</p>

<p>The boys accompanied Jerrold into the back yard,
where he had the air ship under a canvas shelter. Payne,
Jerrold's assistant, was working around the car. As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as Jerrold had told Payne what was wanted, the latter
began making the Eagle ready.</p>

<p>"This is a great town for flying machines," remarked
Ferral, as he watched the operation of getting the craft
ready for a voyage.</p>

<p>"Jerrold has done a whole lot toward solving the problem
of aërial navigation," said Matt. "It was his work
that made the Hawk as good as it is. You see, Brady
used to work for Jerrold, and he stole most of his ideas
for the Hawk from the Eagle."</p>

<p>"A regular skull-and-cross-bones pirate, that Brady,"
muttered Ferral. "I hope we can lay him by the heels
and cut short his lawless career."</p>

<p>While the Eagle was being made ready, Harris and
Carl arrived together on the scene of operations. Harris
wore civilian clothes and looked like anything but a
police officer.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, rubbing his hands, "this reminds me
of that other time, Matt, when Carl and Jerrold and I
went chasing the Hawk in order to get hold of you. I
hope we'll have better success this trip than we had before."</p>

<p>"Ve vill," declared Carl. "Matt iss mit us, now, und
dot means dot ve vill haf more luck. He iss der lucky
poy, all der dime."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Carl," laughed Matt a little
grimly, "my luck seems to have taken a turn."</p>

<p>"Did you look after Miss Brady, Carl?" queried Ferral.</p>

<p>"Vell, I bed you. She hat a good meal, und den I pud
her apoardt a drain for der city. She vanted me to say
to you dot she vas mooch opliged."</p>

<p>"We're under more obligations to her than she is to
us," went on Ferral. "Kind of strange, it strikes me,
that she should be willing to give us a tip about her
father."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't think it strange, Dick," said Matt
warmly, "if you knew the girl better. She knows that
her father, if he is not captured, will go on and on in
crime until he does something that will earn him more
than a mere prison sentence. She wants him captured,
and the Hawk taken away from him. That was her
plan when Brady captured me and held me a prisoner in
Willoughby's swamp. But she wouldn't leave her father
when I came away. She considered it her duty to stay
with him up to the very last moment. It's a good thing
for her that her father went away like he did. Now
Helen can look out for herself, and do it with a clear
conscience."</p>

<p>"All ready, friends," called Jerrold. "Step into the
car and we'll start for Michigan."</p>

<p>Payne was not to go with the searching party. Jerrold,
Matt, Carl, Harris, and Ferral were to be the passengers.</p>

<p>All climbed aboard and took the places to which Jerrold
assigned them. Jerrold himself was to run the
motor, but he had Matt near by to "spell" him now and
then. Carl and Ferral were to act as lookouts, and were
placed as far forward as the car would allow them to go.</p>

<p>Ferral's position was almost opposite Matt's. The
stability of the air ship depended a good deal on its
"trim," and the positions taken by the passengers at the
start were to be kept throughout the trip.</p>

<p>Weighted bags at each end of the cigar-shaped envelope
were used for giving the required angle for rising or
falling. The pull of a lever drew in the bag at the forward
point, and the Eagle inclined upward. Payne had
already pulled aside the top of the canvas protection.</p>

<p>"All ready," said he.</p>

<p>The motor was started, and presently the power was
switched into the propeller. The air ship took the push
and arose slowly and easily into the air.</p>

<p>"Ve're off!" shouted Carl. "I hope, py shinks, nodding
goes wrong und ve come down in der lake. Verral und
I haf peen in der lake vonce, und it don'd vas any fun,
I tell you dot."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">GRAND HAVEN.</p>


<p>Jerrold soon demonstrated the fact that the Eagle was
a much faster craft than the Hawk. As already stated,
there was scarcely any wind, so the Eagle had practically
no adverse air current to contend against. Pointing the
air ship east by south, Jerrold tuned up the engine, and
the speed they made was marvelous. They could form
a tolerable idea of the swiftness of their flight by watching
the surface of the earth, some five hundred feet below
them.</p>

<p>"She's certainly a swifter craft than the Hawk," remarked
Ferral.</p>

<p>"I will improve the Hawk for you," said Jerrold, "so
she will be just as swift as the Eagle."</p>

<p>"Oof ve efer ged der Hawk pack, vich ve don'd know,"
struck in Carl.</p>

<p>"We <i>must</i> get her back," averred Matt.</p>

<p>"The biggest trouble with air ships equipped with
gasoline," continued Jerrold, "is the fact that the slightest
change in the temperature affects the buoyancy. Even
a cloud over the sun will cause the gas to contract, and
the difference in heat thrown off by the sun at morning
and noon will expand the gas and also disturb the equilibrium.
Now I have an improvement that remedies that.
It consists of a smaller bag inside the gas bag, filled with
a vapor of my own invention. When the buoyancy of the
outer bag decreases, that of the inner bag increases, and
<i>vice versa</i>. That gives us a unit of buoyancy which is
always the same, and leaves the propeller free to carry
us in any direction."</p>

<p>"Greadt!" cried Carl. "I don'd ondershtand vat you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
vas gedding ad, aber I bed it vas somet'ing fine. Ach!"
and he looked downward, "here ve go ofer der lake. I
hope dere iss some ships all along der vay, so dot oof
anyt'ing habbens ve can trop down ondo vone oof dem."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about our dropping into the water, Carl,"
smiled Jerrold, "for there is absolutely no danger of
that."</p>

<p>In an hour the Eagle was out of sight of land. The
sails of one or two schooners could be seen far away on
the horizon, but they were too far off to be considered
"company."</p>

<p>As the Eagle plowed on and on through the sunny air,
with never a hitch or a sign of anything going wrong,
Carl's fears slowly subsided and he took delight in this
novel experience of crossing a large body of water.</p>

<p>For a time, Matt relieved Jerrold at the motor. So
far as the young motorist could see, the Eagle handled
as easily as the Hawk; besides that, there were points of
superiority about her, in addition to speed, as compared
with the Brady air ship.</p>

<p>For three hours the Eagle was over the lake, and
then Ferral, with a shout, announced:</p>

<p>"Land ho, messmates, right under our fore foot!"</p>

<p>Harris examined the shore line, critically. A little later,
when they were nearer, he turned to Jerrold.</p>

<p>"We're a bit south of Grand Haven," said he, "about
two miles, I should judge. I can see the cottages on the
trolley line that follows the lake shore."</p>

<p>Jerrold was about to shift the steering rudder so as to
point the Eagle directly for the town, when Matt interposed.</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said Matt, "that it would be better for
us to land outside the town and go in on the trolley. If
we took the Eagle over the place, the whole town would
be out to see us. That would make it impossible for us
to take this Ochiltree by surprise, and might give Brady
and his gang a chance to clear out."</p>

<p>"That's a level-headed suggestion," declared Harris.
"An air ship arouses everybody's curiosity, and if Brady
and his gang saw us, or heard about us, they'd know at
once that we were on their track with the Eagle. Make
a landing on the lake shore, Jerrold. That ought to be
easy, as the beach is clear of obstructions and covered
with good white sand."</p>

<p>"It's never hard for me to make a landing with the
Eagle," said Jerrold. "I can come down anywhere, and
ascend from anywhere."</p>

<p>He took a look over the side.</p>

<p>"Right ahead looks like an excellent place," he went on,
as he drew back. "The trees run right down to the
beach, and there are no houses near. That means that
our descent will be screened, and that we'll not arouse
so much curiosity as we would if we alighted in a more
populous place."</p>

<p>Instructed by Carl, Ferral, and Harris, Jerrold brought
the air ship to rest on the beach without the slightest
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Now to call on this fellow Ochiltree," said Harris
briskly, as he stepped out of the car. "We can't all go,
and I'd suggest that Carl stay here with Jerrold and
watch the car while Matt, Ferral, and I call on the police
department here and see if we can find out where Ochiltree
lives."</p>

<p>Carl's face fell. If there was going to be any trouble,
he had hoped that he would have as big a part in it as
any of the rest of them.</p>

<p>Ferral, noting Carl's long face, clapped him on the
back.</p>

<p>"Don't go into the doldrums, my hearty," cried Ferral.
"If Brady and his gang should find out that the Eagle is
here, you and Jerrold may have more trouble on your
hands than the rest of us."</p>

<p>Carl brightened visibly.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," said he, "I hatn't t'ought oof dot. Aber
you bed you can drust us to dake care oof der Eagle."</p>

<p>Without waiting longer, Harris led Matt and Ferral
through the timber and to the tracks of the trolley line.
They had not long to wait before a car came along,
headed toward Grand Haven. Apparently, neither the
conductor nor the motorman had seen the descent of the
Eagle, for they had nothing to say about the air ship.</p>

<p>"We're playing in great luck, right at the start-off,"
said Harris, in a low tone. "In how many places in this
country, do you think, could an air ship come down without
having a curious crowd around it inside of five minutes?
Not many, I'll bet; and yet, here we make a landing
in the midst of a summer resort and not so much as
a dog comes out to bark at us."</p>

<p>"A good thing for us, too," returned Ferral. "If
there's anything to be accomplished in Grand Haven, we
can do it, for all the odds are in our favor."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Harris. "That's the point I was trying
to make."</p>

<p>In ten minutes they reached Grand Haven, and in
fifteen minutes they were at police headquarters, and
Harris was having an interview with the head of the
department. Harris was not long with that official, and
when he came out he took a chair between Matt and
Ferral.</p>

<p>"Prospects are bright," said he. "The chief here knows
all about Ochiltree, and says he's a shady character and
has a record. We've got to wait for a few minutes for a
plain-clothes man who is going with us to call on the
party."</p>

<p>"Did the chief say anything about another air ship?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I was coming to that," went on Harris. "Yes, another
air ship was seen crossing over the town about two
hours ago. Everybody was out to look at it, and the
chief says there were four or five men in the car."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be Whipple, Pete, Harper, and Brady,"
put in Matt.</p>

<p>"That's the way I had figured it out. Young Brady
wasn't picked up by the other four that got the Hawk
away from you at the balloon house. It would be a great
piece of work if we could capture the whole gang."</p>

<p>Just then a small man, with a restless black eye and a
beak-like face, pushed up to where Harris and the boys
were talking.</p>

<p>"My name's Dennison," said he. "The chief has told
me what you wanted, and I'm to take you to Ochiltree's
place."</p>

<p>Harris gave Dennison his name and introduced Matt
and Ferral.</p>

<p>"We hadn't better lose much time," suggested Dennison.
"The fellow we're looking for is usually at home
this time of the day."</p>

<p>"The quicker we can wind this up, the better," said
Harris. "Lead the way, Dennison, and we'll be right
behind you."</p>

<p>The course they followed took them across the river
and then along the opposite bank in the direction of the
life-saving station. There, in a patch of scrub, they came
upon a small, shanty-like house.</p>

<p>As a precautionary move, Dennison went around to
the back door, and left Harris and the boys to present
themselves at the front.</p>

<p>It was well this precaution was taken. Although
Harris rapped and pounded, no one answered his summons
for several minutes. When a voice was finally
heard from within the house, it was Dennison's.</p>

<p>"Come in, Harris," he called. "If the front door's
locked, come around to the back of the house."</p>

<p>The front door, however, was not locked. Harris and
the boys opened it and walked in. They found Dennison,
revolver in hand, standing in front of a sulky, black-whiskered
man, who was sitting in a chair.</p>

<p>"He didn't like your looks," explained Dennison, "and
so he wouldn't open the door. On the contrary, he tried
to get away by the rear of the house, and so ran into me.
All that looks suspicious, on the face of it."</p>

<p>"I'm tryin' ter do an honest turn," growled Ochiltree,
"an' you cops keep naggin' me. It's a wonder I don't go
wrong, when ye're all expectin' me to."</p>

<p>"What did you try to duck by the back way for?"
demanded Dennison.</p>

<p>"I ain't anxious fer callers," was the sullen response.</p>

<p>"Has Brady been here to see you?"</p>

<p>"Brady?" queried Ochiltree. "Who's Brady?"</p>

<p>"Come, Ochiltree, that won't go down. You haven't
forgotten your old friend Brady, have you?"</p>

<p>"Never heard o' such a feller. If he's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt, who had been looking curiously around the room,
glimpsed some one through the front window, stealthily
approaching the house.</p>

<p>"Hist!" the young motorist whispered, turning to
Harris. "Here comes Harper, now."</p>

<p>Ochiltree began to squirm uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"Luck again!" muttered Harris exultantly. "Keep
Ochiltree covered, Dennison, and be sure he doesn't open
his mouth to call a warning. I'll take care of Harper.
He's one of the gang and can give us a line on Brady."</p>

<p>Harris stole noiselessly to the door. Matt likewise
crowded up close to it on the other side.</p>

<p>The instant Harper rapped, Harris flung the door open,
and he and Matt grabbed the astounded caller and
dragged him into the room.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE LINE ON BRADY.</p>


<p>Harper's astonishment was so profound as to be ludicrous.
Naturally he could not recognize Harris, even
as being a policeman, but he could hardly fail to be
astounded at seeing Matt and Ferral.</p>

<p>With a revolver in his hand, Harris drove Harper into
a chair beside Ochiltree.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what's the meanin' o' this?" asked Harper,
in faltering tones, his bewildered eyes roaming from Matt
to Ferral, and then to Ochiltree.</p>

<p>"You'll find out the meaning of it before you're many
minutes older," answered Harris, with a snap of the jaw.
"Why, you murderous hound," he went on, "how can you
look at King, there, and at his friend, Ferral, and find
the nerve to put such a question? I suppose you've forgotten
how you tied these two lads, put them in the little
room back of the balloon house, and then turned on the
gas?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't me done that," protested Harper.</p>

<p>"It was you, just as much as it was Whipple or Pete.
The law won't make any fine distinctions, I can tell you,
when it comes to playing even for that bit of dastardly
work. You're in a hard row of stumps, Harper. I don't
know as anything can be done to help you, either, but if
you show a disposition to help us, it won't hurt you any."</p>

<p>"Nothin' happened to them two kids," growled Harper,
recovering a little of his courage, "an' I knew all the time
they'd get clear."</p>

<p>"Use the soft pedal!" warned Harris. "You didn't
have any such notion. Anyhow, the law will handle you
almost as it would if both boys had been smothered to
death. It wasn't anything to your credit that they got out
of that room alive. But you're not the main object of
our expedition. Where's Brady?"</p>

<p>"Who told you where we was?" asked Harper, ignoring
the question.</p>

<p>"Some one gave us the tip, and that's enough for you
to know. Where's Brady?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know where he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you do!"</p>

<p>The muzzle of Harris' revolver was pushed closer to
Harper's face. He cringed away from it with a frightened
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't get careless with that," he whined. "I'm not
goin' to run away."</p>

<p>"You're right you're not. It wouldn't do you any
good if you did try. Where's Brady? I'm not going to
ask you many times."</p>

<p>"Who're you?" demanded Harper. "What right you
got to ask me things like that?"</p>

<p>"I'm an officer from South Chicago," and Harris
pulled back his coat and showed the badge pinned to his
vest.</p>

<p>"And I," spoke up Dennison, going through the same
movements, "am a Grand Haven officer. You're nigged
good and plenty, my man. If you know when you're well
off, you'll help rather than hinder this game we're playing."</p>

<p>Harper cast an appealing look at Ochiltree. The latter
met the look savagely.</p>

<p>"What ye lookin' at me fer?" he snapped. "I don't
know you&mdash;never seen ye before in my life. Ye can see
what trouble ye've got me in by comin' here. Take him
away an' jug him," Ochiltree added, turning to Harris.
"He's nothin' ter me, an' I'd like ter have ye git him out
o' this house as soon as ye kin."</p>

<p>"We'll jug the two of you, Ochiltree," answered Dennison
grimly, "until we find out just where you stand in
this business."</p>

<p>Ochiltree relapsed into his chair with a black scowl.
This byplay between Ochiltree and the officer did not
serve to make Harper any more easy in his mind.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell us anything about Brady?" demanded
Harris. "I'm waiting."</p>

<p>"What's it goin' to mean to me?" asked Harper, wishing
to drive some sort of a bargain on his own account.</p>

<p>"It may help you, but I'm making no promises."</p>

<p>Harper bowed his head and, for a moment, thought the
matter over. Evidently he made up his mind that he was
cornered, and that it would be well for him to take a
chance at doing something for himself.</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Where is Brady?" repeated Harris.</p>

<p>"He's out on the trolley line that leads toward Grand
Rapids."</p>

<p>"Is the Hawk there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Something went wrong with the Hawk's motor,
and Brady sent me after Ochiltree while he was tinkering
with the machinery."</p>

<p>"Sent you after Ochiltree, did he?" echoed Harris.
"Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. I guess Brady was plannin' to have Ochiltree
help him to steer clear of the law."</p>

<p>"Consarn you!" flared Ochiltree, glaring at Harper.
"What ye tryin' ter git me inter this thing fer? I'll admit
I useter know Brady," he went on, turning to Dennison
and Harris, "but I ain't had a thing ter do with him fer
years. Why he comes to me now, like this, is more'n I
know."</p>

<p>"It looks bad for you, Ochiltree," commented Dennison.</p>

<p>"I know that," scowled Ochiltree, "an' all because o'
this mutt. He's doin' his best ter ring me in on the deal,
but I'll swear I ain't got a thing ter do with it."</p>

<p>"We'll find that out for ourselves."</p>

<p>"How far is the Hawk from town?" queried Harris,
again taking up his line of questioning with Harper.</p>

<p>"About two miles," was the prisoner's answer.</p>

<p>"How'll we know the place when we get to it?"</p>

<p>"There's a broken oak close to a platform where the
cars stop to take on an' let off passengers. Ye can't miss
the place. Get off at the platform and walk to the right,
straight into the timber."</p>

<p>"Was Brady to wait there until you and Ochiltree
joined him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How long will it take Brady to repair the Hawk?"</p>

<p>"He figured on a couple of hours."</p>

<p>"Who's with him?"</p>

<p>"Pete and Whipple."</p>

<p>"No one else?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What's become of Hector, Jr.?"</p>

<p>"He's gone East. Brady thought Hector, Jr., had better
cut out of Chicago after what happened on the lake."</p>

<p>"I see." Harris turned to Dennison. "We've got a
good line on Brady," he continued. "We'll take Harper
and Ochiltree to the lockup, and then we'll pick up another
officer and go to the platform by the blasted oak,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know the place," broke in Dennison. "I've passed
it a dozen times on the way to Grand Rapids. The quicker
we pull off the rest of this the better."</p>

<p>"My notion to a t, y, ty."</p>

<p>Harris snapped a pair of iron bracelets about Harper's
wrists, while Dennison gave the same delicate attention
to Ochiltree.</p>

<p>"I'm blamed if I can understand why ye're treatin' me
in this way," growled Ochiltree.</p>

<p>"Your actions are suspicious," replied the Grand Haven
officer.</p>

<p>"I can't keep crooks from callin' on me," protested
Ochiltree.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better," was the significant response.
"Come along, Ochiltree, and come peaceably."</p>

<p>Ferral walked on one side of Ochiltree, and Matt
walked on one side of Harper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>With this escort, the two prisoners were removed from
the house, taken across the river and conducted to police
headquarters.</p>

<p>If success was to attend the rest of the officers' movements,
there was no time to be lost. The two prisoners
had been paraded through the town, and there was the
possibility that the news of their arrest might reach
Brady and his men in advance of the arrival of Harris
and Dennison.</p>

<p>Another officer was secured. While the three plain-clothes
men were waiting for the car, Harris endeavored
to persuade Matt and Ferral to go back to the Eagle and
leave the rest of the work to him, and Dennison, and the
other officer.</p>

<p>"Keelhaul me if I cut adrift at this stage of the game,"
answered Ferral. "Why, it's just beginning to get exciting."</p>

<p>"I feel the same way, Harris," spoke up Matt.</p>

<p>"If Brady does any shooting, Matt," answered Harris,
"you can gamble that it will be in your direction. The
scoundrel has got it in for you, and he'll take any chance
to play even, no matter what it costs him."</p>

<p>"I'll look out for myself," said Matt confidently. "Besides,
Harris, you're overlooking one important point.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Suppose Brady hasn't got the Hawk in shape. It
would be necessary for some one that understands a gasoline
motor to lay hold and finish the job. Who could do
that, if I wasn't along?"</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, broken at last by Dennison.</p>

<p>"The youngster is right," said he. "Perhaps he'll be
needed."</p>

<p>"What's more," averred Ferral, "Matt and I own the
Hawk, and it's right and proper that we should be there
to look after it. If there's any shooting, you fellows see
that the air ship isn't hurt."</p>

<p>"We'll do our best to look after the Hawk," answered
Harris, "but we can't forget that the capture of Brady
and his men is our principal business."</p>

<p>"Here comes the car," announced Dennison. "Tumble
aboard and we'll start off on the last lap of the chase."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WOODS BY THE RIVER.</p>


<p>There was a wait on a siding, a little way out of town,
for another car from Grand Rapids to pass on the single
track of the trolley system. Five minutes were lost, and
Ferral fretted and fumed.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, son," said Harris soothingly. "We're
on the way, you know, and a little wait like this isn't going
to make much of a difference."</p>

<p>"It might, matey," answered Ferral. "A whole lot can
happen in five minutes."</p>

<p>At last the car got under headway again and rushed
over the remaining distance.</p>

<p>"I'd better get off alone," suggested Dennison, just as
the car began slowing up for the platform. "If Brady
has anyone watching the platform, the fellow won't know
but that I'm Ochiltree, or some one sent by Ochiltree and
Harper. The rest of you go on a little way, get off, and
double back. Show your badge to the conductor, Harris,
and he'll let you off anywhere."</p>

<p>This was a good idea, and Dennison deserved credit for
thinking of it at the last moment. The success of the
whole plan might depend upon the ruse.</p>

<p>Dennison debarked on the platform, and, when the
car pulled out, those still aboard saw him stepping off
the planks and pushing into the timber that grew close
up to the stopping place.</p>

<p>Matt and Ferral, as the car went on, saw the broken
oak at the end of the platform. It was a plain enough
landmark and not easily to be passed or mistaken.</p>

<p>"Harper is playing square with us, matey," remarked
Ferral, pointing to the tree.</p>

<p>"It looks that way, Dick," agreed Matt.</p>

<p>"Here's where we get back our air ship," jubilated
Ferral. "Sink me, though, but the loss of that flugee
gave me a scare."</p>

<p>"We haven't got it back yet, old chap."</p>

<p>"I know that, but I feel in my bones that we're going
to. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the car began to slow down. Harris had got
out of his seat, with the other officer, and had gone back
to the conductor. Evidently the badges worn by the two
men had caused him to slow down the express car for a
halt in defiance of rules.</p>

<p>The boys, heeding a call from Harris, got up and ran
back along the aisle. They jumped off, after the two
officers, and the car resumed its course to Grand Rapids.
But there was a mighty curious conductor on the rear
platform. As long as the car remained in sight of the
four who had debarked, he looked back and wondered
what was up.</p>

<p>"We'll go back quietly," said Harris. "The river is
just over there, and the woods lie between it and the
trolley line. We'll get to the river bank and follow it
back. That ought to bring us out close to the place where
the Hawk landed. Follow me, Twitchell," he added to
the other officer, "and you boys," he finished, "come along
behind Twitchell. Quiet's the word."</p>

<p>Harris darted into the timber, which bordered the track
closely. The underbrush had evidently been cleaned out,
so that the timber had the appearance of a grove. On
one of the trees, near the track, Matt saw a big white sign
bearing the words, "Lots for Sale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The river, as it proved, was hardly more than a stone's
throw from the trolley track. Turning along its bank,
Harris led the way back toward the vicinity of the broken
oak and the platform.</p>

<p>They all knew they had not far to go, but they were
startled at the suddenness with which Harris turned on
them before they had followed the river bank for more
than two or three minutes.</p>

<p>"I can see the Hawk," whispered Harris. "She's just
ahead. And Brady is there&mdash;and Dennison, too. They're
talking. I can't see Pete or Whipple, and those rascals
may be laying low to carry out some black plan of
Brady's&mdash;but we'll see about that. Come along, and keep
behind the trees as much as you can."</p>

<p>As Harris turned about, he drew his revolver. Twitchell
likewise got out a weapon. Then the party separated,
and each advanced from tree to tree.</p>

<p>It was not long before Matt and Ferral, who were advancing
near each other, were able to get a good look
at their air ship.</p>

<p>The Hawk had descended in a cleared space hard by
the river, and seemed to be in good condition. She was
moored to the ground with two ropes at the front and
rear of the car, the ropes being tied to trees.</p>

<p>Coming a little closer, the boys were able to see Brady
and Dennison.</p>

<p>Brady had his coat off and his shirt sleeves rolled up.
He was holding a heavy wrench in his hand and had evidently
been working with the motor when Dennison presented
himself. The two men were talking, and Matt and
Ferral were able to hear what passed between them.</p>

<p>"What did you say your name was?" inquired Brady,
evidently distrustful.</p>

<p>"Gammon," answered Dennison. "I'm a pal o' Ochiltree's."</p>

<p>"Where's Harper?"</p>

<p>"He stayed behind at Ochiltree's house."</p>

<p>"Why was that? I told Harper to come and to bring
Ochiltree with him."</p>

<p>"I'll tell ye the why of it, Brady. Ye see, the perlice
are watchin' Ochiltree good and hard, an' if he was seen
comin' here with Harper, the two of 'em might be follered.
Ochiltree got word ter me ter come an' put the
situation up to you, an' to tell ye that he an' Harper 'u'd
be along when it got dark, as it wasn't safe ter come in
broad day."</p>

<p>"I see," muttered Brady, studying Dennison with his
gimlet eyes.</p>

<p>"Harper said ye had two more men with ye," went on
Dennison, playing his game easily and evidently edging
closer for a chance to lay hold of Brady and make him
a prisoner. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>"They're off watching the platform. I reckon they'll be
along in a minute. Prob'ly they followed you, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that precise moment, Pete and Whipple broke out of
the timber. They came up directly behind Dennison and
laid hands on him before he could make a move to defend
himself.</p>

<p>"What you doing?" yelled Brady, leaping forward.</p>

<p>"Grabbing an officer," said Whipple, with an oath.
"His name's Gammon, all right, an' the talk he was givin'
ye, Brady, was pure gammon, an' nothin' else."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>Brady's voice, as he put the question, was hard and
metallic, and he measured Dennison with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>"Why," explained Whipple, "when he got off'n the
keer we seen some 'un else through a winder. I'm a sinner
if it wasn't Matt King. Now, whatever was King
doin' on that keer? By rights, he ort ter hev got shuffled
out o' the game, across the lake in that balloon house.
But he didn't, an' here he is, travelin' on the same keer
with a feller as says his name is Gammon, an' that he
comes from Ochiltree."</p>

<p>Dennison, as he was held helpless in the hands of Pete
and Whipple, was studying the timber covertly, but none
the less anxiously.</p>

<p>"What have you got to say for yourself?" cried Brady,
advancing threateningly upon Dennison.</p>

<p>Matt and Ferral had been wondering why Harris and
Twitchell had not shown themselves. Unable to hold
back any longer, the boys dashed forward.</p>

<p>The noise they made drew the instant attention of
Brady, Whipple and Pete.</p>

<p>"There's King now!" yelled Pete.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, Brady dropped the wrench and drew a
revolver.</p>

<p>A sharp, incisive note echoed through the woods and
across the river. Matt felt the wind of the bullet as it
passed his face.</p>

<p>"Look out, matey!" bellowed Ferral. "Duck for a
tree! You're not armed, and can't take any chances. He's
going to shoot again."</p>

<p>But it was not necessary for Matt to get behind a tree.
Before Brady could fire another shot in his direction,
Harris and Twitchell rushed upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Drop your guns!" cried Harris sternly. "Stand right
where you are! You're our prisoners!"</p>

<p>Brady, however, was made of sterner stuff. A prison
cell was yawning to receive him, and he knew it.</p>

<p>Whipple and Pete, astounded by this sudden demonstration,
paused undecided. Their fingers relaxed, and
Dennison leaped away from them.</p>

<p>"Treachery!" roared Brady; "Harper has sold us out!
Fight for it, boys!"</p>

<p>Dennison, being nearer Brady than any of the rest,
jumped for him. He tried to draw his revolver, but it
stuck in his pocket. Brady had leveled his weapon at
point-blank range, and only Motor Matt's quickness, at
that moment, saved the officer's life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt, watching the fight breathlessly, had instinctively
picked up a stone. Now, seeing Dennison's danger, he
hurled the stone at Brady with all his strength.</p>

<p>The missile sped true, struck Brady's arm with terrific
force and caused the revolver to drop. With wild yells,
Harris and Twitchell rushed forward to capture Brady
and his two men.</p>

<p>But Pete and Whipple, not knowing the extent of the
forces against them, thought best to trust their liberty
to their heels. Whirling around, they darted into the
timber, leaping from tree to tree as they ran in order to
screen themselves from any bullets that might be sent
after them.</p>

<p>The bullets came fast and thick, but evidently without
doing any damage, for Whipple and Pete did not slacken
pace.</p>

<p>Brady, swearing like a pirate, turned on Dennison like
a madman, grabbed him about the waist and, with a tremendous
display of strength, held the officer in front of
him. Still swearing, he began backing into the timber,
with the intention of making his escape as Pete and Whipple
had done.</p>

<p>Seeing that he would be likely to effect his purpose,
Matt and Ferral doubled around behind him and suddenly
hurled themselves upon him from the rear.</p>

<p>Brady fought like a tiger. Matt could not have believed
that one man possessed so much strength. Dennison,
whose temper was fiercely aroused by the turn events
had taken, jerked loose from Brady and turned to help
the boys.</p>

<p>Harris and Twitchell, seeing that Brady was as good
as captured, took after Pete and Whipple.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BRADY A PRISONER.</p>


<p>Matt, Ferral and Dennison were not long in getting
the whip hand of Hector Brady. As Matt and the officer
held him down, Dennison called to Ferral to get a rope.</p>

<p>Ferral got a rope from the car and the desperate thief
was finally secured, wrist and ankle. Even then he continued
to struggle and roar his defiance of his captors.</p>

<p>"You might as well calm down," cried Dennison, picking
up the revolver which Matt's missile had knocked
from Brady's hand. "Your goose is cooked, Brady, and
there's no use tiring yourself out."</p>

<p>After a few moments Brady seemed to realize this.</p>

<p>"You've got me, but you won't keep me," he snarled.</p>

<p>"If you can get away from us," replied the officer,
"you're welcome to your liberty. But you won't get
away. I had too close a call at your hands to let you do
that."</p>

<p>"Who in the fiend's name are you?"</p>

<p>"A plain-clothes man from the Grand Haven police
headquarters."</p>

<p>"Did you get this tip from Harper?"</p>

<p>"Harper couldn't help himself. He and Ochiltree are
in the lockup."</p>

<p>Dennison turned to Matt and grabbed his hand.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for you, King," said he, "I'd have been
laid out. You were quick as a cat and as certain as fate.
I never met your kind before, and it does me good to
shake hands with you. I'm mighty glad," he added, with
a grin, "that we couldn't persuade you to stay behind, in
Grand Haven."</p>

<p>"That's the way this raggie of mine does things, Dennison,"
remarked Ferral, looking at Matt admiringly.
"He's chain lightning when he turns himself loose."</p>

<p>"The best part of it all is," observed Matt, anxious to
change the subject, "no harm has happened to the air
ship."</p>

<p>Throwing off his coat and cap, Matt lost not a moment
in diving into the machinery. He could see nothing
wrong, and he "turned over" the engine and set it to going.
It worked perfectly.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for trouble," growled Brady, turning
his head to follow Matt's movements, "you won't find
any. I've fixed the motor&mdash;just got through with it when
this cop in plain clothes showed up. If I'd known who
he was&mdash;&mdash;" and Brady finished with a diabolical light in
his eyes that told plainly what he would have done.</p>

<p>"Pass it up," said Dennison curtly; "you came within
an ace of getting me, as it was."</p>

<p>"King balked me again, just as he has been doing right
along," went on Brady fiercely. "I'd willingly have gone
to Joliet for life if I could have nicked him. He's the
cause of all my troubles."</p>

<p>"Bully for King!" applauded Dennison. "The more I
hear of him the higher he stacks up with me."</p>

<p>"Who put you next to where I was going, King?" demanded
Brady.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," replied Matt, getting into his
coat and cap again. "We've captured you, Brady, and
that's enough for you to know."</p>

<p>"Captured, but not sent up," qualified Brady. "Nor I
won't be sent up. I'll live and have my liberty until I
can settle accounts with Motor Matt and some more of
you fellows."</p>

<p>"Let him rave," laughed Dennison. "That's the only
thing he can do, and it won't hurt anybody."</p>

<p>"If it was that girl of mine that tipped me off to you
and Harris," went on Brady, "she's one of those who'll
come in for a fair share of the trouble I'm going to turn
loose. Nice kind of a daughter she is! It's been the
grief of my life that she never was more like Hector, Jr."</p>

<p>Matt listened to this in amazement, and his heart sickened
as he turned away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment, Harris and Twitchell came hurrying
back.</p>

<p>"Where are the other two?" cried Dennison.</p>

<p>"I'd give a bunch of pay if I knew," answered Harris,
very much put out. "We couldn't locate them, and the
thing for us to do, Dennison, is to get back to headquarters
and use the telegraph and the telephone."</p>

<p>He hurried forward to Brady's side.</p>

<p>"You're in Michigan," said he, "and you're wanted in
Illinois. Will you waive requisition?"</p>

<p>"Waive nothing!" shouted Brady. "All you get out of
me you'll fight for."</p>

<p>"Personally," said Harris contemptuously, "I don't care
a toss-up. We've got you, Brady, and we've got you
right. By staying in Michigan until requisition papers
are put through you're only delaying a game that can
have only one termination."</p>

<p>"Well," was the scowling response, "we'll wait for the
termination. Maybe somebody will get fooled before
we're at the end of this."</p>

<p>Harris turned away to Matt and Ferral.</p>

<p>"Twitchell, Dennison and I," said he, "will take Brady
to Grand Haven and put him in the lockup with Harper.
They'll both stand out for requisition, and they'll have to
be left on this side of the lake until our governor can get
the case before the Michigan executive. Have you looked
over the Hawk, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Much tinkering to be done on her?"</p>

<p>"Brady had already fixed the motor so that it works
as well as ever."</p>

<p>"Then you and Ferral had better get aboard and make
a getaway to the place where Jerrold and Carl have the
other air ship. As soon as I finish my work in Grand
Haven, I'll join you and we'll all go back to South Chicago
together. Your hard luck has certainly taken a turn
for the better, Matt, and we want to make sure that you
don't have any more backsets. Whipple and Pete are
loose in the timber, and I'll bet they'd give their eyeteeth
to be able to capture the Hawk. We want to keep them
from doing that, or from trying it. We'll take Brady
back on the trolley, but before we start I want to see you
well away in the Hawk."</p>

<p>"It won't take us more than a couple of minutes to get
under way," returned Matt. "All aboard, pard," he
added to Ferral. "Get into our air ship, old chap, and
we'll go on a still hunt for Carl and Jerrold and the
Eagle."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, Captain Matt," laughed Ferral, getting into
the car.</p>

<p>Matt followed him aboard and settled himself in the
driver's seat.</p>

<p>"Cast off the ropes, Harris, you and Dennison," called
Matt.</p>

<p>Harris was familiar with that part of the work, and he
and Dennison soon had the air ship unmoored and the
cables in the car. The river offered a clear stretch for
rising, and Matt turned the Hawk in that direction.</p>

<p>The motor began to pop and then to settle down to a
steady hum. Matt manipulated the steering rudder,
switched the power into the propeller, and the Hawk
arose gracefully accompanied by the cheers of the officers.</p>

<p>But no cheers came from Brady. With baleful eyes he
watched the Hawk's departure.</p>

<p>"That's the second time you've taken my air ship away
from me, King," he roared. "The next time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There'll never be a next time," cried Harris. "You're
down and out, Brady, and you'd better begin to realize
it."</p>

<p>Up and up mounted the Hawk, the river lying below
her like a silver ribbon, entangled among the greenery
of the trees. Off to the west sparkled the waters of the
lake, and in between the Hawk and the shore lay Grand
Haven, cottages and farms, all spread out like a map.</p>

<p>"Getting a bird's-eye view of a scene is a heap finer
than looking at it from the ground," observed Ferral,
leaning over the Hawk's rail and feasting his eyes on the
panorama below.</p>

<p>"We're in good trim to enjoy looking down at the
landscape from the Hawk," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Right-o, matey," answered the young sailor. "I'd
about given up ever taking another ride in the Hawk.
We're thirty-five hundred to the good by this afternoon's
work."</p>

<p>"That's the least of what we have accomplished," said
Matt. "The capture of Brady is a bigger thing than the
recovery of the air ship."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," said Ferral, "but I'm sorry those
other two beachcombers got away. They'll be making
trouble for some one later."</p>

<p>"Harris will get quick action over the telegraph and
telephone," said Matt, "and the chances are good for
the overhauling of Pete and Whipple."</p>

<p>"I hope so, and that's a fact. Say, I'll bet Carl and
Jerrold will be surprised when they see the Hawk coming
for their part of the beach."</p>

<p>"Keep a good lookout, Dick, and let me know when
you sight the Eagle. This is unfamiliar territory to me,
and your eyes will have to guide us."</p>

<p>"As I get the bearings," said Ferral, leaning over the
rail and peering ahead, "we ought to be about east by
north of where we want to land. When we took the
trolley we went east."</p>

<p>"That's right," returned Matt. "Keep your gaze south
and west, and you ought to be able to pick up the Eagle."</p>

<p>A few moments later Ferral sighted the swaying bulk
of the other air ship.</p>

<p>"Bear to the left a little, Matt," said he, "and we'll
come down right where we want to go. I can see Jerrold
and Carl standing on the beach and looking up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
us. I'll bet they're wondering whether we're in the car,
or whether Brady and his gang are the passengers."</p>

<p>"Wave something at them," suggested Matt. "We
don't want to scare them."</p>

<p>Ferral waved his handkerchief. This calmed the fears
of Carl and Jerrold, if they had had any, and Ferral reported
that they were waving their hats.</p>

<p>A few moments later Matt engineered an easy landing,
and the Hawk was moored within a dozen yards of the
Eagle.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">BACK IN SOUTH CHICAGO.</p>


<p>There was some great rejoicing on Carl's part when he
learned what had happened in Grand Haven and out
along the trolley line to Grand Rapids.</p>

<p>"Ach, aber dot all sounds too goot to be droo!" exulted
the Dutch boy. "I vish I hat peen dere during der fragas.
Ferral vas fooling mit me ven he saidt dot Jerrold und
I mighdt haf more drouples as der resdt oof you. Dere
don'd vas any tanger oof dot at any stage oof der game.

vill sail avay mit demselufs py Noo York. Der palloon-house
plot ditn't vork oudt like Prady t'ought."</p>

<p>"It would have worked out just as he planned," said
Matt, "if it hadn't been for Helen Brady."</p>

<p>"Yah, so! Miss Prady safed der tay for all oof us.
Ven ve shdart for Noo York now, Matt? Oof ve vaid
too long, den meppy dose odder two fellers, Vipple und
Pete, vill hatch some more plots. I don'd like dot. Der
kevicker vat ve get avay, der pedder all aroundt."</p>

<p>"Carl's got the marlinspike by the right end, old ship,"
said Ferral to Matt.</p>

<p>"That may be," answered Matt, "but I think we ought
to find out something more about what Helen Brady intends
doing before we leave Chicago."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" agreed Ferral. "I was forgetting about
that. She's mighty independent, though, and I doubt
whether she'll let us do much to help her."</p>

<p>"That's one of the things I like about Helen Brady."</p>

<p>Matt went over the Hawk and found that she would
need more gasoline before the trip back across the lake
was attempted.</p>

<p>Jerrold was also wanting a supply, and he and Matt,
leaving Carl and Ferral in charge of both air ships,
started for the nearest house to find out where they could
get the fuel of which they stood in need.</p>

<p>They found that gasoline was used for cooking, and
for manufacturing gas for lighting, in the house where
they inquired. The man who owned the place kindly offered
to let the air ship owners have all they needed.</p>

<p>In less than an hour Matt and Jerrold were back and
filling their gasoline tanks.</p>

<p>A little later Harris reached the scene. The sun was
down and darkness was coming on.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get away any quicker," explained Harris.
"I am leaving everything in good shape here, though.
Harper is willing to go back to South Chicago without
any requisition papers, but I thought it best to let him
stay and take him across the lake at the same time we
took Brady."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be better," agreed Matt.</p>

<p>"Harper is ready to turn states' evidence against the
gang in the hope of getting a light sentence," went on
Harris. "He claims to know where some more stolen
property has been secreted, so I suppose there will be a
few happy people in South Chicago if he proves that he
knows what he's talking about."</p>

<p>"The law will deal lightly with Harper, I suppose," put
in Jerrold, "if he does all that."</p>

<p>"I guess so, but the law will not let him off scot free.
Harper will go to the 'pen,' but he won't get anywhere
near the sentence that Brady will."</p>

<p>"How long will Brady go up for?"</p>

<p>"That's hard to say, but it will be long enough to keep
him out of mischief for twenty or thirty years."</p>

<p>"What is going to be done with Ochiltree?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Ochiltree will be kept in the lockup until
the officers in this part of Michigan have had a chance
to capture Whipple and Pete. After that, Ochiltree will
be turned loose."</p>

<p>"What are the chances for capturing Whipple and
Pete?"</p>

<p>"Good. We have used the wires in every direction, and
also coupled a description of Grove with the descriptions
of the other two."</p>

<p>"Why, shiver me," cried Ferral, "I hadn't thought
about Grove! What became of him, Harris?"</p>

<p>"Harper says that Grove was put down on the lake
shore, just before Brady and the rest started across. I
don't know how true that is, and I'm just telling you
what Harper told me. But Harper's information has
panned out straight goods, so far. He says that Grove
showed signs of weakening, and that Brady, in a temper,
cut loose from him. It may be that Grove will join
Whipple and Pete, somehow, and I thought it well to
telephone and telegraph his description along with the
others. But what are we going to do, Jerrold? Wait
here until morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't think we'd better," said Jerrold. "The night
bids fair to be as calm as the day has been, and we can
cross the lake easily enough by moonlight. If we wait
until to-morrow we may have a high wind, and perhaps
a storm. Air ships, and flying machines of every sort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ought to be under cover in a time like that. We'd better
make the most of the good weather. Don't you think so,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"You know more about air ships than I do, Mr. Jerrold,"
answered Matt, "but, from my brief experience
with the Hawk, I think a storm would be bad business
for an air ship. I've weathered out storms in balloons,
but it's possible, with just a plain gas bag, to get above
the clouds and the tempest. You can't safely do that with
machines like ours."</p>

<p>"Well," said Harris, "if we're going to South Chicago
to-night, the quicker we start the quicker we'll get there.
I'll confess I'm not in love with the idea of hanging out
on this beach all night with these two air ships. We can't
tell what might happen, with Grove, and Pete, and Whipple
at large."</p>

<p>"Then," said Jerrold, "we'll pull out at once. You
start first, Matt, and we'll follow."</p>

<p>"I'll ride mit my bards," said Carl, "und Harris can
come mit you, Misder Jerrold."</p>

<p>The ropes were cast off and Matt man&oelig;uvred the
Hawk upward and out above the lake. When they had
got a good "offing," as Ferral described it, those in the
car could look back and see the dark, weird shape of the
Eagle flinging itself upward against the lighter background
of sky.</p>

<p>What little wind there had been, during the day, had
gone down with the sun, and perfect silence, save for the
lapping of the waves, reigned on every hand.</p>

<p>The Eagle soon overhauled the Hawk, and side by side
the two air ships made toward the Illinois shore.</p>

<p>Could anyone in a boat have seen the air ships, the
sight presented would have been strangely exciting. The
spectacle would have been prophetic, too, of man's coming
command of an element heretofore out of his reach.</p>

<p>As time passed, the moon arose as if out of the water,
and a scene of weird beauty unrolled to those aboard the
Hawk and the Eagle.</p>

<p>"I vould radder be a sailor oof der air dan oof der
sea," remarked Carl, breaking a silence during which
all hands had been enjoying their novel surroundings.</p>

<p>"Why so, Carl?" came across from the Eagle, in the
voice of Harris.</p>

<p>"Pecause," said Carl, "you got four vays to go insteadt
oof two. In a sea ship, you don't vas aple to go oop und
town."</p>

<p>"Once in awhile, matey," laughed Ferral, "a sea ship
goes down."</p>

<p>"Yah," averred Carl, "und she shdays town. Go on
mit dot song vat you vas singing mit yourseluf, Tick, der
dime vat you vas coming py der poarding house to see
Matt. It vas a pooty fine song, I tell you dot."</p>

<p>Ferral had a fine voice, and he at once broke into "In
Cawsand Bay Lying," and followed it through from start
to finish.</p>

<p>Harris thereupon tuned up, and when he got through
Carl piped out in German. This singing was kept up, off
and on, during the entire trip across the lake.</p>

<p>It was decided, just as the air ships were hoving over
South Chicago, that Matt and his chums should take the
Hawk to the balloon house and stow her away there.
Harris would go on to Jerrold's place in the Eagle, and
then send a couple of policemen from headquarters to
watch the Hawk until the boys were ready to leave.</p>

<p>This programme was carried out without a break. It
was about three o'clock in the morning when the boys
got their sand bags in place along the bottom rail of the
car and towed the Hawk into her old berth.</p>

<p>Half an hour after that a detail of two officers arrived
and went on guard. Matt, Ferral and Carl went into the
small room at the back of the balloon house, and two of
them took possession of the cots and the third had a
bed made for him on the floor. It was Carl who stretched
out between the two cots, and it was he who remarked,
just before he dozed off to sleep:</p>

<p>"You fellers came pooty near daking a long shleep
here, hey?"</p>

<p>"Stow it, matey!" cried Ferral. "I'll be dreaming
about that now."</p>

<p>"Ach, donnervetter!" returned Carl, "dere iss pedder
t'ings as dot to tream aboudt, Ferral. For insdunce,
tream oof der vay Matt shtruck some shtreaks oof hardt
luck, und den turned der hardt luck to goot atvantage py
gedding Prady gaptured."</p>

<p>"And recovering the Hawk," added Matt. "There's a
silver lining to every cloud, Dick."</p>

<p>"There's never a flat foot nor a shellback but will tell
you same thing, messmate," agreed Ferral heartily.
"Good night, or good morning, whichever you want. I'm
ready to take my stretch off the land, and here goes."</p>

<p>Two minutes later the fateful old balloon house was
steeped in silence.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RED_SPIDER" id="THE_RED_SPIDER">THE RED SPIDER.</a></h2>


<p>"This," said Phil Clode, setting down his bag, "is the
limit!"</p>

<p>Having given vent to which expressive remark, he laughed
to himself and gazed round upon the most desolate scene
that it had ever been his fortune to behold. Behind him
stood a small, wooden erection, not unlike an enlarged run,
which was, however, dignified by the name of station. For
the rest, a clove-brown plain stretched away to infinity,
marred only by the shining ribbons of the railway track and
an occasional clump of cactus or greaseweed.</p>

<p>"The limit," the boy repeated solemnly. "Hullo! there's
a man, or something very like one. I will get a line on to
his vicinity, and try to extract a little useful information."</p>

<p>Picking up his grip, he hustled over to where a specimen
of the cowboy genus had lounged from behind the station,
leading a broncho that looked rather the worse for wear.
Phil, as he approached, saw that a bag branded with the
sign "U. S. Mail" was slung over the beast's saddle, and his
eyes brightened. He knew that even in that deserted region
of Colorado any servant of Uncle Sam's could be trusted.</p>

<p>"Say," he sang out. "Can you give me any notion where
I am, mister? I was told to get off at Silver Bridge, and
here I am right enough, but I can't see much sign of the
town."</p>

<p>"You on foot?" the other returned with undisguised astonishment.
"You must be stark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Broncho waiting for me at Silver Bridge," Phil interrupted
shortly. He had urgent reasons for not wishing to
talk about his private affairs.</p>

<p>"So?" the man muttered with a sidelong glance. He had
a pleasant face, rough but good humored, and the lad took
to him instinctively. "You're an Easterner, ain't yeh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and proud of it."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I'm from the East, too, only I've been
here so long that yeh wouldn't think it. I guess yeh'd better
hop up behind me, pardner. Betsy's a game chicken&mdash;she's
carried three before now."</p>

<p>"You going to Silver Bridge, then?" Phil queried as the
cowboy stroked the unprepossessing broncho fondly.</p>

<p>"I should smile. I'm cattle tender to the ore-crushing
plant there."</p>

<p>Phil received this information with a start, but made no
remark. In silence he mounted behind the man, who gave
his name as Idaho Bart, and felt with some surprise the
plain bumping rapidly away beneath them, as the broncho,
becoming a bunch of throbbing muscles, pounded eastward
with the regularity of tirelessness of a steam engine.</p>

<p>The mail rider did not seem disposed to let the silence
continue. Out West curiosity about another man's affairs
is usually the signal for gun play, but Idaho Bart proceeded
to break the rule by a series of interrogations of the most
pointed and particular description.</p>

<p>Phil Clode, however, was old for his years, and he met
him at every point, giving a false name, and a reason for
his arrival at Silver Bridge that was so obviously wide of
the truth that the mail carrier, having turned in the saddle
to fix him with a twinkling eye, emitted a short laugh, and
relapsed into taciturnity.</p>

<p>This muteness remained undisturbed until they were in
sight of Silver Bridge, the big ore-crushing town, the shares
of which, back in Wall Street, were at a premium. It appeared
suddenly as they topped a swelling hill that surrounded
two sides of the city like a wall, and Phil surveyed
it with the curiosity of first acquaintance. It reminded him
of a battle ship out of action&mdash;of something Titanic which is
wrapped in incongruous slumber. Though only midday, not
a sound rose from the vast collection of shacks and wooden
buildings. The mighty ore crushers and distributors were
idle, the men lounged listlessly round the two hotels, and the
river swirled past unstained by the red of washed metal.</p>

<p>The river? In those two words lay the tragedy&mdash;the
reason of the inaction that spelled ruin to thousands, including
the canvas-coated men who diced and gambled and swore
in the saloons. For the river was now a mere meandering
stream, and the power that worked the mills was gone, leaving
the great plant worse than useless, for it would cost more
than it was worth to entrain it to any place where there
would be the likelihood of a buyer.</p>

<p>"Looks pleasant, I don't think," Idaho Bart said bitterly
as he watched Phil's keen, dark eyes glancing over the
drowsy, deserted streets, splashed golden by the afternoon
sun. "Two weeks ago yeh would have opined that yeh were
back in New York. Busy? I guess we had got the Fountain
of Youth faded to a Harlem ash can, when it came
to hustling."</p>

<p>"And now the river's gone," the boy rejoined quietly. His
remarks were all couched to extract information without
giving any in return.</p>

<p>"Say, that's a right hook on the jaw of truth! It's a
lead-pipe cinch that this is about the most mysterious thing
that ever gave a whole layout brain storm. The river
stopped in the night, and we woke up to find this here dribble.
The men are going to pike out, if there don't come a change
'fore Saturday."</p>

<p>Phil muttered something to himself.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out what has dammed the source of
the river?" he asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"Say, yeh are a young green-growing thing, all ready
canned and labeled!" Bart sniggered. "Do you know that
the source of Silver River is up in Black Cañon?"</p>

<p>"What of that?" queried Phil ingenuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, come off! This ain't the season for spring chickens,
I reckon. I only know of three men what have been into
Black Cañon, and come out alive. Two o' them were engineers
belonging to the United States Reclamation Service,
and they had the time of their lives. The other was a Indian,
and went in to escape the posse that was trailing him
for hoss stealing. He said afterwards that he wished he'd
stopped and been lynched."</p>

<p>Phil made no reply to these revelations, for they were
now in the main thoroughfare of Silver Bridge, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
ore-stained men were lounging up with a tumultuous outcry
for the mail. They also bestowed upon the boy the benefit
of their rather doubtful wit, but, finding that they got rather
better than they sent, soon betook themselves back to the
enticements of the saloons, leaving Idaho Bart to take the
few official letters up to the office.</p>

<p>"Say, kid, where are yeh going?" he drawled as he strode
away with the loping movement peculiar to the riders of the
plains.</p>

<p>"To Mr. Allsoner," Phil returned carelessly, keeping pace
with him.</p>

<p>He made a clucking sound in his cheek.</p>

<p>"If yeh are after a job, yeh'd better carry your store
clothes away along the shining homeward track right now,"
he said poetically. "Old Allsoner's hoppin' mad, and he'll
have yer scalp before yeh could say Teddy."</p>

<p>"I don't want a job," was the irritating reply, and Phil
grinned as he noted the other's mystification.</p>

<p>The office of Mr. Allsoner, general manager of Clode's
Silver Bridge Reducing Company, Limited, was not an imposing
structure. In fact, it might well have been taken for
a stack of damaged firewood by the uninitiated, but Phil
Clode did not make this mistake. Suddenly shouldering his
way ahead of Idaho Bart, he entered the office at a run, and
disappeared into the manager's private office&mdash;the most
sacred spot in the whole townstead&mdash;with a coolness that left
the two clerks in the outer department absolutely petrified.</p>

<p>Mr. Allsoner, however, was far from being petrified, and
he had already used more adjectives than could be found in
any dictionary before he looked up, started as though he
could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses, and ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Phil Clode!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," was the ungrammatical rejoinder. "Father's
got to keep his eye on the market, or we'd go up in a balloon
before an hour was through, and there was nobody else to
come. Mr. Allsoner, there's treachery afloat."</p>

<p>The keen-eyed business man uttered an exclamation of
wonderment, and then, rising, locked the door.</p>

<p>"Spit it out," he said tersely.</p>

<p>"You know our river is stopped."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"It's been dammed purposely."</p>

<p>The manager had just seated himself, but he leaped up
again at these quietly spoken words.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! The source is in Black Cañon."</p>

<p>He made his rejoinder with an air of finality, as though
there was no room left for argument.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, father overheard a conversation between
two Wall Street brokers that convinced him that they have
paid some bad man to dam the river for a time. It's a certainty,
not guesswork."</p>

<p>Mr. Allsoner stared at him in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I may be dense, Phil, but I fail to see what good damming
our river would do to anybody."</p>

<p>"You are dense," smiled the boy. "Don't you see? Silver
Bridge river runs dry. Panic in Wall Street, and two-hundred-dollar
shares sold in bucketfuls, and bought by the men
who have had the river dammed. Then, after, say, a month,
when they've got control of every share in the market, down
comes the river again, up go the shares to top notch, and
they've netted a cool million."</p>

<p>Silence reigned for a minute, while the manager reviewed
this startling idea. Then he murmured "Jove!" in the tone
of one seeing visions.</p>

<p>"You couldn't tell me who's working the rig, could you?"
he asked facetiously. The realization that the stoppage was
only temporary acted like a tonic. "The boys would give
him a lively time, if they got their fingers in his wool. It
would be a case of the nearest telegraph pole."</p>

<p>"The man mentioned," Phil answered in a cautious whisper,
"was nicknamed Red Spider."</p>

<p>"What! By heavens, you are right! Red Spider is an
outlaw half-breed, horse stealer, cattle runner, murderer, and
everything else abominable. He is known to have a cache
up in the hills, too."</p>

<p>"Then catch Red Spider before eleven o'clock to-morrow.
At that hour there is a meeting, and the state of affairs here
will become public property. The river must be running
before then."</p>

<p>"There isn't a man here that will go into the Black Cañon,
and I don't blame them," the manager declared hopelessly.
"It's certain death."</p>

<p>"What Red Spider can do we must do."</p>

<p>"He's discovered some secret way. Besides, a cross between
an Omaha Indian and a Mexican produces something
tougher than a white man."</p>

<p>"I start at midnight," said Phil Clode, strolling toward the
door.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes after midnight when Phil Clode rode
out of the town.</p>

<p>He was alone. As one man the ore workers had jeered
at the idea of attempting to penetrate into the famous Black
Cañon. They had already been as far as possible, and found
the river unstopped. It had failed at its source, they argued.
Such things had been heard of before. Mr. Allsoner did not
agree with this latter conclusion, but he was entirely convinced
that any attempt to enter the cañon would be futile,
and he did not scruple to tell Phil so.</p>

<p>The boy, however, although he pretended to accept the
manager's decision as final, secretly determined to make an
attempt at solving the mystery single-handed. He knew that
the failure to resume operations on the morrow would mean
ruin to his father, and with the impetuosity of youth he
stigmatized the ore workers as a pack of "superstitious
grandmothers."</p>

<p>Once out of sight of the camp, he urged his game little
steed to a gallop, and set off to where the mountains rose
stark and flat against the mauve-colored rim of the horizon,
keeping his course by the dried river bed that led the way
into the very heart of Black Cañon.</p>

<p>After about an hour's hard riding the track grew even
too steep for the broncho, and Phil, tethering the animal to
a rock, made his way forward on foot. Gradually the walls
of rock rose up and encompassed him, leaving only a strip
of sky faintly seen above his head, and the stillness became
so unearthly that he paused occasionally to cast a stone down
a chasm for the mere pleasure of hearing it rattle.</p>

<p>Arrived at the entrance of the cañon, he halted and surveyed
the way for a few minutes. As Allsoner had told
him, the river&mdash;now a morass of horrible mud&mdash;entirely
filled the gulch from side to side, rendering progress without
a boat an impossibility. The dam controlling the flow, however,
was built half a mile farther up, and this was reached
by a species of aërial railway, built on the plan of the old
overhead switchbacks, with a car slung to a double rope,
worked by block and pulley on the return journey.</p>

<p>It was certainly not an inviting mode of progression, but
Phil did not falter. Setting his teeth, he grasped the iron
ladder that led up to the summit of the first trestle, and
mounted steadily. By the time that he reached the top the
wind was shrieking in his ears with demoniac fury, and the
trestle seemed to sway bodily before the furious gusts, although
only a mild and gentle breeze could be felt in the
cañon below.</p>

<p>Buttoning his fluttering jacket tightly around him, he
stepped nervously on to the flat, swaying car, and fumbled
with the two hooks that held it in place, being secured to a
couple of iron rings in the top corners.</p>

<p>With a sudden swoop the frail craft left its moorings, and
Phil found himself spinning at a dizzy speed through space.
Presently the slope became less steep, and as his conveyance
slackened speed he was able to look about him.</p>

<p>Not that there was much to be seen, even though the moon
rendered it nearly as light as day. Before him the ropes ran
on in an everlasting stream, and on each side nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
visible but the walls of rock, smoothed in places by human
handiwork to allow of the passage of the traveling cradle.
Occasionally the car would almost stop as it passed with a
shock over the platform of one of the trestles, and Phil
found that, by clutching the railings at the proper moment,
he could arrest it without feeling any particular strain.</p>

<p>He had closed his eyes, and was almost enjoying the rush
through the scented night air, when he felt a sudden shudder
run through the car, as if it had struck against something.
Opening his eyes hastily, he peered round, and then a terrified
cry rose to his lips.</p>

<p>The swaying cradle had a new passenger, in the shape of
a picturesquely garbed Mexican, who glared upon the boy
with fierce wolfish orbs, fiery and bloodshot, as he flourished
a long-barreled revolver in his face.</p>

<p>Phil did not need to inquire who the stranger was.</p>

<p>He guessed, and rightly, that it was Red Spider, the outlaw
of the plains, who stood before him.</p>

<p>"Carajo!" the man hissed gutturally, thrusting the firearm
forward until it snicked the boy's nose. "Whose baby are
you? Why are you here? Answer, or over the side you go!"</p>

<p>Leaning forward, he seized Phil's wrist in a vise-like grip,
and forced him slowly toward the edge of the car.</p>

<p>"Come to that, who are you?" the boy retorted pluckily.
"You've got less right than I have to be here, I guess."</p>

<p>The half-breed's teeth grated with fury at this impertinence.</p>

<p>"I am left here to guard the trestle railway," he yelled,
with a curse. "And my duty is to shoot brats who have no
business here!"</p>

<p>He pushed the revolver into Phil's face, gradually forcing
him nearer and nearer to the edge of the vibrating car.</p>

<p>"You find so many boys trying to steal rides on the trolleys,
don't you?" that worthy choked, keeping his wits by a
mighty effort of will. He could see that they were rushing
rapidly toward the last platform, and, if he managed to cling
on till then, he might manage to escape, hopeless as it
seemed.</p>

<p>Reaching out as the Red Spider made a vicious lunge, he
caught hold of one of the iron crossbars that secured the
car to the rope, and held on like grim death. The outlaw,
with a shriek of fury, lifted his revolver, and his finger was
pressing upon the trigger when the last platform stopped
their progress with appalling abruptness. Phil, clinging desperately
as he was, narrowly escaped being flung off, and the
Mexican, unprepared for the impact, literally hurtled through
the air. Over the boy's head he flew, spread-eagled and
screaming, and went down&mdash;down&mdash;down, with the swiftness
of a shot bird, and disappeared into the purple mists that
veiled the bottom of the cañon from sight. A crash, a single
soul-appalling scream, and Red Spider had vanished forever
from the sight of men.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, Phil Clode lay for a few minutes without
tempting to move. Then he rose cautiously, and, keeping
his eyes averted from the dreadful cañon, commenced the
descent. Before he had reached the bottom all his natural
courage had returned, and he pressed on with renewed
energy, inspired by the idea that the outlaw might have left
some trail which would lead to his hiding place.</p>

<p>It was black as within a tomb now, for the rocky walls
towered up and up higher than the eye could reach.</p>

<p>The track was no more than a smear along the face of the
cliff, and Phil began to realize the difficulties that he was to
encounter as he proceeded inch by inch, clinging on with
teeth and hands, with a thousand-foot drop waiting below.
The path, too, grew narrower, and he was just about to relinquish
his herculean task in despair when he saw a gleam
of light&mdash;lantern light&mdash;searing the eternal glooms like a
streak of fire, and not twenty yards ahead of him as he
rounded a sharp bend.</p>

<p>In another minute Red Spider's secret lay revealed.</p>

<p>A square of rock, fitted with powerful hinges, had been
opened inward, and the lantern set in the entrance as a guiding
light when the outlaw returned. Beyond, the path grew
so narrow that it was a human impossibility to scale it;
below, until the mysterious catastrophe of its cessation, lay
the river, sliding and thundering in cascades and waterfalls,
and usually fifty feet or more deep. Phil realized that the
passage of Black Cañon was a thing to be dreamed of, and
not attempted.</p>

<p>Taking up the lantern, he set off at a brisk pace up the
sandy tunnel at the entrance of which it was placed, keeping
his eyes open for pitfalls and fissures. The passage led to
the right, and perceptibly upward, and ere long he found
himself walking parallel with what had once been the river.</p>

<p>After an hour's hard walking he came suddenly into a
spacious cave, and found himself gazing once more at the
oozing river bed, and at&mdash;Red Spider's dam!</p>

<p>Yes, there it was, a great mass of blocks of stone, walling
the cañon from side to side, and cunningly diverting the
foaming water into a subterranean stream that had been uncovered
and channeled for the purpose. Picks and ropes,
and blocks of stone, were strewn around in every direction,
and just over the mouth of the underground river hung a
platform of planking supported by countless ropes, and loaded
with a ton or more of cut rock.</p>

<p>Phil was not long in doubt as to its use.</p>

<p>With a little bubbling cry of joy he produced his clasp
knife, and went to work busily to hack the ropes in twain.</p>

<p>A score of them were severed, when an ear-splitting crack
made him start hastily back. Next instant the whole load of
rock fell with a mighty crash, completely blocking the entrance
to the subterranean stream that had been draining the
life from the river.</p>

<p>Something had to give way, and Red Spider's cunningly
constructed dam was directly in the path of the river as it
swelled, and rose, and bellied upward. Then, with a roar
louder than any thunder, it broke the barrier away, and
hurled itself into Black Cañon with irresistible fury, to race
and tumble down to where the Silver Bridge Reducing Company's
plant was waiting to sully its foaming waters with
the red stain of the ore.</p>

<h2><a name="PIGEON-WHISTLE_CONCERTS" id="PIGEON-WHISTLE_CONCERTS">PIGEON-WHISTLE CONCERTS.</a></h2>


<p>A traveler in Eastern lands tells the following little story
of the Chinese and their most unique pigeon whistles.</p>

<p>"One of the most curious expressions of emotional life in
China is the application of whistles to a flock of pigeons.
These whistles, very light, weighing hardly a few grammes,
are attached to the tails of young pigeons soon after their
birth, by means of a fine copper wire, so that when the
birds fly the wind will blow through the whistles and set
them vibrating, thus producing an open-air concert, for the
instruments in one and the same flock are all tuned differently.
On a serene day in Peking, where these instruments
are manufactured with great cleverness and ingenuity, it is
possible to enjoy this aerial music while sitting in one's
room.</p>

<p>"There are two distinct types of whistles&mdash;those consisting
of bamboo tubes placed side by side, and a type placed
on the principle of tubes attached to a gourd body or wind
chest. They are lacquered in yellow, brown, red, and black
to protect the material from destructive influences of the
atmosphere. The tube whistles have either two, three, or
five tubes. In some specimens the five tubes are made of
ox-horn instead of bamboo. The gourd whistles are furnished
with a mouthpiece, and small apertures to the number
of two, three, six, ten, and even thirteen. Certain
among them have besides, a number of bamboo tubes, some
on the principal mouthpiece, some arranged around it. These
varieties are distinguished by different names. Thus a
whistle with one mouthpiece and ten tubes is called 'the
eleven-eyed one.'"</p>

<p class="bb center huge">MOTOR STORIES</p>


<p>Most five-cent weeklies are founded upon the adventures of boy wonders who perform all sorts of
impossible feats and who never act or talk as a boy really does. This is displeasing to the intelligent boy of
the present day, who is better educated, and who, consequently, demands more logical reading than the
old-time boy did.</p>

<p>The boys who want to learn something from what they read, as well as to be interested by it, will
never find another publication that will satisfy them so well as MOTOR STORIES. "Motor Matt" is not
an impossible boy character. He is simply a youth who has had considerable training in a machine shop
where motors of all kinds were repaired, and who is possessed of a genius for mechanics. His sense of
right and wrong is strongly developed, and his endeavors to insure certain people a square deal lead him
into a series of the most astonishing, but at the same time the most natural, adventures that ever befell a boy.</p>

<p>Buy the current number from your newsdealer. We feel sure that you will be just as enthusiastic
about it as the fifty thousand other boys throughout the United States have become.</p>
